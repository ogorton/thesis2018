% Example SDSU Mathematics/Physics LaTeX Thesis.
% Lines beginning with % are comments and are ignored.
% 
% The class file sdsu-thesis.cls must be in the current directory or
% installed with the other classes as per standard LaTeX installation.
% 
% To generate run these commands:
% latex  thesis
% bibtex thesis
% latex  thesis
% latex  thesis
% Then you need to use the dvips command to get postscript output
% 
% See the README file for more information
% sdsu physics uses chapter class...
\documentclass{sdsu-thesis-chap}
%
% For early printouts to save paper use the savepaper option as
% 
% \documentclass[savepaper]{sdsu-thesis}
% 
% 
% This will make things single spaced, use small font and smaller
% margins.  Stuff will be formatted differently if you don't use this
% option but it's useful to basically see (read) what you typed so far
% on paper without wasting much paper.  You might want to also comment
% out the front matter and backmatter if printing out in savepaper
% mode to save paper there.  Do not use this option on your final
% printout as it doesn't satisfy the thesis manual requirements.


% Also if you want to use double spacing rather then single spacing (if
% your thesis is very short, say 25 pages or less), then use the
% `doublespace' option as
% 
% \documentclass[doublespace]{sdsu-thesis}

\begin{acknowledgments}
I am grateful to my advisor and professor, Dr. Calvin Johnson, for guiding me
through this, my first research project. His feedback and suggestions made
this thesis better than it otherwise could have been. His instruction and our countless
conversations and group meetings have enabled me to complete this research
and to develop my scientific method. I would like to thank Dr. Kenneth Nollett and Dr. Kate Rubin 
for reviewing this manuscript and for their flexibility while serving on my committee.
I also extend my thanks to my officemates for reading early drafts 
of my thesis and for listening to my presentation
and offering their feedback.
