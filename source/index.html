<h1 id="chap:intro">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Nuclear physics is the study of the structure and properties of atomic nuclei, which make up most of the known matter in the universe. The goal of nuclear theory is to make predictions about the interactions of nuclei with external fields, in order to answer questions about experimental outcomes and thereby related deeper and ongoing questions in physics about the fundamental symmetries of nature.</p>
<p>Some of the more important and open questions in physics, such as those related to the matter-antimatter symmetry violation, the source and origin of dark matter in the universe, and neutrinoless double beta decay, all rely on accurate and detailed quantum models of nuclei. Investigations into neutrinoless double beta decay call for transition matrix elements from <span class="math inline">\(^{76}\)</span>Ge and <span class="math inline">\(^{76}\)</span>Se<span class="citation" data-cites="Faessler Brown2"></span>. Some searches for dark matter involve collisions with heavy nuclei such as <span class="math inline">\(^{131}\)</span>Xe, and require detailed nuclear structure calculations<span class="citation" data-cites="Bednyakov"></span>. Finally, the origin of the matter-antimatter symmetry violation may be due to CP-violation<span class="citation" data-cites="Sakhorav"></span>, and one approach to investigating the source of CP-violation is through the permanent electric dipole moments of certain nuclei such as <span class="math inline">\(^{199}\)</span>Hg<span class="citation" data-cites="Willmann"></span>.</p>
<p>In order to understand observations obtained from experiments, or to make predictions about future experiments, we need to be able to compute the matrix elements of operators with accurate nuclear wavefunctions computed from detailed Hamiltonians. I will be addressing the task of computing accurate wavefunctions from existing Hamiltonians, by solving the quantum N-body problem as a matrix eigenvalue problem. Because the complexity of many body problems scales exponentially with the number of particles, the dimension of these matrices can very large. This is especially true for medium and heavy nuclei. As a particular example, calculations of the parity violating nuclear “anapole moment” for nuclei such as <span class="math inline">\(^{133}\)</span>Cs and <span class="math inline">\(^{205}\)</span>Tl rely on accurate ground state wavefunctions, and one- and two-body density matrix elements<span class="citation" data-cites="Haxton89 Haxton02"></span>. <span class="math inline">\(^{133}\)</span>Cs in the configuration interaction shell model, a kind of matrix eigenvalue problem, has a basis dimension of over one-hundred million and requires nearly <span class="math inline">\(800\)</span> GB of memory to store just the non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. Given the enormity of such problems and finite computer memory, it becomes of interest to find ways to reduce the size of such matrices. In principle, this can be done by truncating the basis and computing only the matrix elements whose basis elements are most important. In this thesis I will present in considerable detail evidence that this is a plausible strategy in a specific framework for our choice of basis. Furthermore, I will present evidence that this should work <em>better</em> for the kinds of cases we will face for medium and heavy nuclei, that is, with unequal numbers of protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>The framework that we will work in is a proton-neutron coupling scheme, the details of which will be discussed in Chapter 5. The evidence will be the <em>entropy of entanglement</em> between protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei, which I will use to show that one can, in principle, efficiently truncate the basis. The question of <em>how</em> this can actually be done is still under investigation. I will present, however, a code which carries out the coupling and give our results to date. While the project of efficiently calculating nuclear properties using a truncated basis is not yet complete, I can demonstrate significant progress towards it.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-background">Mathematical Background</h2>
<p>In this and the following section I give a brief introduction to the mathematical underpinning of the nuclear many body problem. I assume an understanding of undergraduate quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Nuclear physics is essentially a quantum many-body problem and much of nuclear physics can be explained by the (non-relativistic) N-body Schrödinger equation: <span class="math display">\[\label{tid}
	\hat{H}\Psi(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,...,\vec{r}_N)=E\Psi(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,...,\vec{r}_N).\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> is the Hamiltonian, which includes kinetic energy and potential energy terms for each particle. The potential energy contains the nuclear interaction and/or other relevant interactions like the Coulomb force<span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson13"></span>. <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> is our wave-function, a function of the position of every particle in the system. If we could solve the Schrödinger equation for every system, the task of the theoretical nuclear physicist would be complete. However, in general, there is no analytic solution to (<a href="#tid" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tid">[tid]</a>) except for in a very small number of cases involving a great deal of symmetry and a small number of particles. In any practical situation where calculations of realistic nuclear structure are required, numerical methods are necessary.</p>
<p>Towards this end, let’s review the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Let us start with an eigenvalue equation of the form <span class="math display">\[\label{hepe}
	\hat{H}|\Psi\rangle=E|\Psi\rangle.\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> is a Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> is a state vector which is a member of the Hilbert space. (A Hilbert space is a vector space with an inner product that is complete in the norm)<span class="citation" data-cites="Hall"></span>. By definition, any basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|\alpha\rangle\}\)</span> must satisfy the completeness relation <span class="math display">\[1 = \sum_\alpha |\alpha\rangle\langle \alpha|,\]</span> thus any state vector <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> can be expressed as the following, where <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_\alpha \equiv \langle \alpha|\Psi\rangle\)</span> <span class="math display">\[|\Psi\rangle = \sum_\alpha \Psi_\alpha |\alpha\rangle.\]</span> For this to be meaningful we will eventually need to choose a particular basis to work in. Starting again from (<a href="#hepe" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="hepe">[hepe]</a>) and substituting this representation of our eigenstate, <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}	
        \hat{H}\sum_\alpha \Psi_\alpha|\alpha\rangle = E\sum_\alpha \Psi_\alpha|\alpha\rangle
\end{split}\]</span> and projecting onto a dual basis state <span class="math inline">\(\langle \beta|\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
	\langle \beta|\hat{H}\sum_\alpha \Psi_\alpha|\alpha\rangle &amp;= \langle \beta|E\sum_\alpha \Psi_\alpha |\alpha\rangle \\
        \sum_\alpha \langle \beta|\hat{H}|\alpha\rangle\Psi_\alpha &amp;= \sum_\alpha \langle \beta|\alpha\rangle E\Psi_\alpha \\
        \sum_\alpha H_{\beta\alpha} \Psi_\alpha &amp;= E\Psi_\beta,
\end{split}\]</span> where the matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> are defined to be <span class="math display">\[H_{\beta\alpha} \equiv \langle \beta|\hat{H}|\alpha\rangle.\]</span></p>
<p>Now that we have represented the Schrodinger equation as a matrix eigenvalue problem, it becomes in principle straightforward to obtain important results such as the energy spectra and transition probabilities of nuclei: simply diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix to obtain the energy spectrum (eigenvalues) and wavefunctions (eigenvectors), which are used to compute observables such as transition probabilities.</p>
<p>Complications include the fact there is really no way to write down a simple analytic Hamiltonian for the nuclear force as there is for classical forces such as electromagnetism. The nuclear force is fundamentally an exchange of mesons requiring quantum field theory to properly describe<span class="citation" data-cites="eisenberg"></span>. Furthermore, even once a Hamiltonian is obtained, solving for its eigenvalues can be a non-trivial computational problem, since the dimensions of the space can be in the many-billions. There are a number of popular computational methods for solving the many-body Hamiltonian, of which the configuration interaction method is an example.</p>
<h2 id="slater-determinants">Slater Determinants</h2>
<p>A common practice in the configuration interaction model is to write the many-body basis states <span class="math inline">\(\{|\alpha\rangle\}\)</span> used above in terms of anti-symmetrized products of single-particle solutions to a single-particle Hamiltonian. Let’s explore what this means.</p>
<p>Because our wavefunctions <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> live in a vector space (more precisely, in a Hilbert space) we can always rewrite <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> in another basis of our choosing. <span class="math display">\[\Psi(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,...,\vec{r}_N)=\sum_\alpha c_\alpha
\Phi_\alpha(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,...,\vec{r}_N)\]</span> This is an N-body wavefunction with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> sets of coordinates, one for each particle. The CI method is to choose our <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> to be a product of single-particle wave functions, <span class="math display">\[\{ \phi_a \},\ a=1,...,d,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the number of single-particle states. These single-particle wavefunctions are chosen to be some convenient basis that will span the Hilbert space of interest. I will discuss the exact nature of the single-particle states in Section <a href="#EISM" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="EISM">1.4</a>. The normalization integral of a product wavefunction is simply the product of the integrals of each factor. However, since nuclei are composed of fermions (spin-1/2 particles), we must have antisymmetric wavefunctions. We therefore need the more complicated rule<span class="citation" data-cites="Dirac"></span>: <span class="math display">\[\label{sld}
	\Phi(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,...,\vec{r}_N)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
    \sum_{i_1,i_2,...,i_N}^N \epsilon_{i_1,i_2,...,i_N}\phi_1(\vec{r}_{i_1})
    \phi_2(\vec{r}_{i_2})\phi_3(\vec{r}_{i_3})...\phi_d(\vec{r}_{i_N}),\]</span> <em>viz.</em> the determinant of the matrix defined by <span class="math inline">\([\phi_a(i_b)]\)</span> with a normalization factor, with index <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> labeling the single-particle state and index <span class="math inline">\(i_b\)</span> labeling the particle number. The antisymmetry is encoded in the Levi-Civita symbol <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i_1,i_2,...,i_N}\)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Jeevanjee"></span>. By defining our many-body wave-functions to be determinants of single-particle wavefunctions we are guaranteed antisymmetric many-body states. These specially constructed states are known as Slater determinants<span class="citation" data-cites="Wong"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="second-quantization">Second Quantization</h2>
<p>Occupation representation is an additional formalism that is used in our representation of wavefunctions. Here I will only state the relevant results of this so-called second quantization formalism. Many-body basis states are no longer represented as the product of coordinate functions of single particle states. Instead, a basis of single-particle states is chosen, perhaps the same set <span class="math inline">\(\{\phi_a\}\)</span> as above, and the many-body states are represented in the abstract as <span class="math display">\[\Psi(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,...,\vec{r}_N)\to\Psi{\{n_\phi\}} = |n_1,n_2...n_d\rangle,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_a\)</span> is the number of particles in the state <span class="math inline">\(\phi_a\)</span>. Without any additional structure, this representation lacks anti-symmetry; this is restored by representing the state <span class="math inline">\(|n_1,n_2...n_d\rangle\)</span> as the action of a series of operators on the vacuum state <span class="math inline">\(|0,0...0\rangle\)</span>, or “particle vacuum”. The operator which turns <span class="math inline">\(|0,0...0\rangle\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(|1,0...0\rangle\)</span> is called the creation operator, and the operator which turns <span class="math inline">\(|1,0...0\rangle\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(|0,0...0\rangle\)</span> is called the annihilation operator. For fermions, these two generalized ladder operators are defined implicitly through their anti-commutation relations<span class="citation" data-cites="Waleka"></span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    \{\hat{a}_i,\hat{a}^\dagger_j\}&amp;\equiv\hat{a}_i\hat{a}^\dagger_j+\hat{a}^\dagger_j\hat{a}_i
        =\delta_{ij}\\
    \{\hat{a}_j,\hat{a}_j\}&amp;=\{\hat{a}^\dagger_i,\hat{a}^\dagger_j\}=0
\end{split}\]</span> These anti-commutation relations encode the properties of systems of fermions: two fermions cannot occupy the same state, <span class="math inline">\((\hat{a}^\dagger_i)^2=0\)</span>, and therefore the maximum occupancy of a state <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> is one. Thus, <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    \hat{a}^\dagger_1 |1,0,...,0\rangle &amp;= 0, \\
    \hat{a}^\dagger_1 |0,0,...,0\rangle &amp;= |1,0,...,0\rangle,\\
    \hat{a}_1 |1,0,...,0\rangle &amp;= |0,0,...,0\rangle, \\
    \hat{a}_1 |0,0,...,0\rangle &amp;= 0,
\end{split}\]</span> and so on for any state <span class="math inline">\(|n_1,n_2...n_d\rangle\)</span>. With this mathematically equivalent structure, we can replace our Slater determinants (<a href="#sld" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sld">[sld]</a>) with occupation representations using second quantization operators. Any many body state can now be written <span class="math display">\[\label{sld2}
    \Phi = |n_1,n_2...n_d\rangle = (\hat{a}^\dagger_1)^{n_1}...(\hat{a}^\dagger_d)^{n_d}|0,...,0\rangle.\]</span> Since each state’s occupation <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> is constrained to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, many body states can be represented by bit strings. For example<span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson18"></span>, <span class="math display">\[\hat{a}^\dagger_1\hat{a}^\dagger_4\hat{a}^\dagger_5\hat{a}^\dagger_7|0\rangle = |1457\rangle = \to
    1001101,\]</span> where we are dealing with a four-body wavefunction in a basis with at least seven single-particle states, and where I have used <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> here in place of <span class="math inline">\(|0,...,0\rangle\)</span> for brevity. This makes computer storage of wavefunctions trivial.</p>
<p>It can be shown that one-body operators can be expressed in the second quantization formalism as<span class="citation" data-cites="Brussard"></span>: <span class="math display">\[\hat{O}=\sum_{ij}\langle i|O|j\rangle\hat{a}^\dagger_i\hat{a}_j,\]</span> where the sum is over all single-particle states. Similarly, two-body operators can be expressed<span class="citation" data-cites="Brussard"></span>: <span class="math display">\[\hat{O}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijkl}\langle ij|O|kl\rangle\hat{a}^\dagger_i\hat{a}^\dagger_j\hat{a}_k\hat{a}_l.\]</span> The factor of one-fourth comes from the fact that the sum is over all single-particle states and would otherwise over count the number of (pairwise) interactions. The Hamiltonian may be rewritten using these representations: <span class="math display">\[\label{nuchamil}
	\hat{H}=\sum_{i,j}\hat{a}^\dagger_i\langle i|T|j\rangle\hat{a}_j
    +\frac{1}{4}\sum_{i,j,k,l}\hat{a}^\dagger_i\hat{a}^\dagger_j\langle ij|V|kl\rangle\hat{a}_l\hat{a}_k,\]</span> where the first term represents the one-body interactions such as kinetic energy or the Coulomb interaction with an external field, and the second term represents two-body interactions (forces between interacting particles) and contains the nuclear force. This formalism is key to the way this model is translated into powerful computer codes which can be used for a number of different calculations.</p>
<h2 id="EISM">Effective Interactions and Shell Models</h2>
<p>A truly realistic model of the nucleus would necessarily involve the description of the exchange of mesons<span class="citation" data-cites="eisenberg"></span>. The basis of single particle states <span class="math inline">\(\{\phi_a\}\)</span> that are used in shell model methods are instead taken to be time independent solutions to quantum potentials which attempt to reproduce the results of a full field theory. Some variation of a mean-field approximation is used to motivate the choice of single particle states. For example, this could be a harmonic oscillator, or the more sophisticated Woods-Saxon potential<span class="citation" data-cites="Brussard"></span>. In both cases, and in all cases considered here, the defining single-particle potential is chosen to exhibit rotational invariance, resulting in states of good angular momentum. In fact we will always choose single particle states with good harmonic oscillator quantum numbers: the radial quantum number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the orbital angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, the total angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, the z-component of the angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(j_z\equiv m\)</span> and the parity quantum number <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Parity <span class="math inline">\(\pi=(-1)^l\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m=-j,-j+1,...,j-1,j\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is common practice to use atomic spectroscopic notation to label the nuclear single-particle orbits (states). Here we will take the convention <span class="math inline">\(nl_j\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is replaced with the letters <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
       l &amp;= 0,1,2,3,4,5,...\\
         &amp;= s,p,d,f,g,...
\end{split}\]</span> For example the first few low-lying levels of a harmonic oscillator-like single-particle potential are shown in Table <a href="#spo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="spo">1.1</a>. (Degeneracy indicates the numbers of states with unique <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in each orbit <span class="math inline">\(nl_j\)</span>. Max fill indicates the sum of all degeneracies up to that orbit and is the maximum number of nucleons of each species that can fill the space up to and including that orbit.). There is a distinction between an orbit <span class="math inline">\(nl_j\)</span> and a state which also includes the z-component of the angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. An orbit labeled as <span class="math inline">\(nl_j\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(2j+1\)</span> possible states since <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is restricted to <span class="math inline">\(-j, -j+1, ..., j-1, j\)</span>. States within the same orbit are degenerate in energy (at least in the absence of any external electromagnetic fields), with <span class="math inline">\(2j+1\)</span> being the degeneracy.</p>

<p>In the harmonic oscillator basis, there are an infinite number of single-particle states. We cannot keep track of an infinite number of states; this would require bit string representations of our many-particle states that are infinitely long. We therefore consider only a finite number of single-particle states, and leave out the rest. We leave out single-particle states which have a very low probability of being occupied, as well as those with a very high occupation probability. This second statement may seem counter-intuitive. How can we ignore states which are occupied? Because these states are assumed to always be occupied, we can account for their contribution to the single-particle energies and two-body interactions while leaving the states out of the active model space. To determine which low-lying states are likely to always be filled, we rely on “magic numbers”. An important observational fact is that the binding energy of certain nuclei with certain numbers of nucleons tend to be especially stable. Nuclei with 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, or 126 protons or neutrons tend to have a higher binding energy than nuclei with one proton or one neutron above these so called magic numbers <span class="citation" data-cites="Segre"></span>. Magic numbers in Table <a href="#spo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="spo">1.1</a> are marked with an asterisk.</p>
<p>In shell model codes, the vacuum state is redefined to be an inert core of nucleons, and the model space to be a finite space of particle-hole excitations near a Fermi surface<span class="citation" data-cites="Heyde"></span>, usually determined by one of the magic numbers. Particles in the set of active, interacting nuclei occupy the “valence” space. For example, we can imagine an inert core of 8 noninteracting protons and 8 noninteracting neutrons, which can be thought of as a frozen <span class="math inline">\(^{16}\)</span>O nucleus. Then, orbiting above this core we can imagine a fixed number of interacting nucleons, valence protons and neutrons. If we restrict the number of valence protons and neutrons to between 0 and 12, then we can represent the entire valence space with just the <span class="math inline">\(d_{3/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d_{5/2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_{1/2}\)</span> orbitals. This is called the <em>sd</em>-shell model space because the s(<span class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span>) and d(<span class="math inline">\(l=2\)</span>) orbital quantum numbers are all that appear in the truncated model space. All quantum numbers for this single-particle model space are shown in Table <a href="#table: sd.spo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table: sd.spo">1.2</a>. (These orbits lie directly above an inert core of 8 protons and 8 neutrons and can support up to 12 valence protons and 12 valence neutrons. Each orbit has <span class="math inline">\(2j+1\)</span> possible values of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, this is the degeneracy. The rightmost column indicates the maximum number of particles that could fill the model space up to that orbit.) The overall effect of the inert <span class="math inline">\(^{16}\)</span>O core is to add an effective energy to Hamiltonian.<span class="citation" data-cites="Heyde"></span>.</p>

<p>To account for the state left out of the model space, an effective two-body interaction can be computed. By enforcing that the effective interaction acting on the model wavefunction reproduces the same results as the full interaction on the full wavefunction, one can expand the effective interaction into a series of the form<span class="citation" data-cites="Heyde"></span> <span class="math display">\[\label{eff}
    V^{eff} = V + V\frac{\hat{Q}}{E - H_0}V + ...\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Q}\)</span> is a projection operator onto the part of the full Hilbert space that was left out of the model.</p>
<p>In our work we rely on commonly used effective two-body interactions computed by others, such as the Universal <em>sd</em>-shell interaction version B (USDB)<span class="citation" data-cites="usdb"></span>. This interaction is not derived using an expansion like (<a href="#eff" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eff">[eff]</a>), however. The USDB interaction and others like it are phenomenological interactions, meaning that it may have started from an effective calculation like equation (<a href="#eff" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eff">[eff]</a>), but then matrix elements were tuned in order to give better fits to widely available measured masses and resonance energies (e.g. from the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC))<span class="citation" data-cites="nndc"></span>. The USDB interaction and other widely used interaction matrix elements are lists of quantities of the form <span class="math display">\[\langle i,j|V|k,l\rangle,\]</span> as appears in equation (<a href="#nuchamil" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="nuchamil">[nuchamil]</a>).</p>
<h2 id="bringing-it-all-together-the-interacting-shell-model">Bringing it All Together: the Interacting Shell Model</h2>
<p>To construct a many-body basis in the interacting shell model, we begin with a shell model space. I will use the <em>sd</em>-shell model space to illustrate the development of this section. This model space has an inert core of 8 protons and 8 neutrons. The contribution from these inactive particles is accounted for in the single-particle energies and two-body matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. We have three single particle orbits (<span class="math inline">\(d_{3/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d_{5/2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(s_{1/2}\)</span>), each with a <span class="math inline">\(2j+1\)</span> degeneracy. We often assume that protons and neutrons have the same set of single-particle orbits. Each orbit has a single-particle energy associated with it. Given the degeneracy of each orbit, we have <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span> possible single-particle states, as shown in Table <a href="#sdstates" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sdstates">1.4</a>. These single-particle states span the valence space, that is, the space of all possible single-particle wavefunctions within the <em>sd</em>-shell model space. Many-particle wavefunctions, i.e. proton or neutron Slater determinants, can be represented with a bit string twelve bits long. If there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> fermions of a given species in the model space, then there are <span class="math inline">\(_{12}C_N\)</span> (twelve choose N) possible Slater determinants. For example, a state with three protons (or neutrons) could be <span class="math display">\[\label{slaterex}
    \hat{a}_1^\dagger\hat{a}_2^\dagger\hat{a}_3^\dagger|0\rangle = |123\rangle = |111000000000\rangle \to 111000000000,\]</span> but there are <span class="math inline">\(_{12}C_3=220\)</span> possible 3-nucleon Slater determinants, many of them degenerate in energy. The single-particle energy of such a state (i.e. ignoring nucleon-nucleon interactions) would be the sum of the single-particle energies of each nucleon.</p>

<p>Equation (<a href="#slaterex" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="slaterex">[slaterex]</a>) is a many-proton or many-neutron Slater determinant. The wavefunction of an atomic nucleus, containing both protons and neutrons, is constructed by coupling together proton and neutron Slater determinants: <span class="math display">\[\label{abasis}
    |\alpha\rangle = |j_p,m_p\rangle\otimes|j_nm_n\rangle,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(|j_p,m_p\rangle=(\hat{a}^\dagger_1)^{n_1}...(\hat{a}^\dagger_d)^{n_d}|0,...,0\rangle\)</span> is a particular proton Slater determinant such as (<a href="#slaterex" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="slaterex">[slaterex]</a>), and similarly for the many-neutron state <span class="math inline">\(|j_n,m_n\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>The number of nuclear Slater determinants can quickly become very large. The <em>sd</em>-shell model space, with 12 single-particle states, has a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(_{12}C_6=924\)</span> single-species Slater determinants, for a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(924^2=853776\)</span> proton-neutron Slater determinants. Fortunately, symmetries of the Hamiltonian, specifically selection rules for quantum numbers allow us to ignore certain combinations of these states, allowing us to reduce the overall size of the basis. If the Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant, then both the total angular momentum operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{J}^2\)</span> and the z-component of angular momentum operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{J}_z\)</span> commute with the Hamiltonian. This makes choices of basis where either <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(J_z=M\)</span> is held constant for all basis states convenient<span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson13"></span>, since for any coupled basis states <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha,M_j\rangle\)</span> with good total <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\langle \beta,M_\beta|\hat{H}|\alpha,M_\alpha\rangle = 0,\]</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(M_\alpha\neq M_\beta\)</span>. This holds true for states of fixed <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> as well, but in general this is less convenient because whereas <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an additive quantum number, <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is not and requires more cumbersome combinations of Slater determinants<span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson13"></span>. Therefore for (<a href="#abasis" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="abasis">[abasis]</a>) we often choose the so-called M-scheme basis where basis states are coupled up to good <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[|\alpha\rangle = [|j_pm_p\rangle\otimes|j_nm_n\rangle]_M \equiv |j_pj_n;M\rangle,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(M=m_p+m_n\)</span>. In terms of our bit representations this means selecting to combine proton slater determinants with neutron Slater determinants that will result in fixed total <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. For example, an atomic nucleus in the <em>sd</em>-shell model space with a single valence proton and a single valence neutron (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>F) for <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> can only have coupled Slater determinants such as <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    |1\rangle\otimes|4\rangle=|j_p=3/2,m_p=+3/2\rangle&amp;\otimes|j_n=3/2,m_n=-3/2\rangle,\\
    |4\rangle\otimes|1\rangle=|j_p=3/2,m_p=-3/2\rangle&amp;\otimes|j_n=3/2,m_n=+3/2\rangle,\\
    |2\rangle\otimes|3\rangle=|j_p=3/2,m_p=+1/2\rangle&amp;\otimes|j_n=3/2,m_n=-1/2\rangle,\\
    |3\rangle\otimes|2\rangle=|j_p=3/2,m_p=-1/2\rangle&amp;\otimes|j_n=3/2,m_n=+1/2\rangle,\\
\end{split}\]</span> etc., where <span class="math inline">\(|i\rangle\)</span> is a single particle occupying the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> single-particle state in Table <a href="#sdstates" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sdstates">1.4</a>. In total there are <span class="math inline">\(28\)</span> possible <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> coupled Slater determinants for <span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>F in the <em>sd</em>-shell model space, translating to a basis and Hamiltonian matrix with a dimension of <span class="math inline">\(28\)</span>.</p>
<p>The M-scheme is highly advantageous. However, if we wish to truncate the basis, the J-scheme becomes preferable. I will explain this in detail in a later chapter, after justifying the need for a truncation of the basis.</p>
<h1 id="chap:purpose">STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h1>
<p>In order to solve the nuclear many-body problem, the Schrodinger equation is recast as a matrix eigenvalue problem. We use an M-scheme configuration interaction code called BIGSTICK <span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson13"></span><span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson18"></span>. Despite the fact that the interaction files used to build the basis for the space are semi-empirical, BIGSTICK and codes like it are still numerically exact, that is, they don’t use any numerical approximations once the Hamiltonian is built, and the basis is not truncated. This means that the error relative to experiment is due to the interaction the code uses and not the method for solving the problem. The error in the results are fairly low, around a few hundred keV, while low-lying states tend to be a few MeV in magnitude. BIGSTICK and configuration interaction codes like it can still be extremely computationally expensive to run for large nuclei, even after an order of magnitude improvement using the M-scheme. Table <a href="#memory" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="memory">2.1</a> contains a short list of the storage space (RAM) required to store just the nonzero matrix elements for various nuclei in different phenomenological model spaces. A discussion of the dimensions of even heavier nuclei can be found in Chapter 7.</p>

<p>Because of the intense computational cost of solving nuclear structure problems, and the limited computer resources available, it is necessary to approximate solutions via truncated model spaces. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the viability of truncating the nuclear many-body basis in a particular framework, a basis of coupled proton and neutron Slater determinants, and to truncate the basis by selecting the most important states. The best method for doing so has yet to be determined, but later in Chapter 5 I will explain the attempt we have made. First I will provide evidence that such a method could be viable.</p>
<p>To do so I analyze the distribution of wavefunction coefficients. This investigation was inspired by a similar study of light to medium mass nuclei using a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the wavefunction coefficients<span class="citation" data-cites="Papenbrock03 Papenbrock04 Papenbrock05"></span>. In those studies, shell model basis states were approximated by truncating the basis in a coupled proton-neutron scheme. Ground state energies in the <em>sd</em> and <em>pf</em> shell, as well as low-lying states, were shown to converge exponentially with basis dimension to those computed with the untruncated basis. The authors examined mostly <span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span> nuclei. The authors also provided no explanation for the cause of the exponential convergence, and restricted themselves to relatively low dimensional problems. In the next chapter, I will take a similar approach by examining the distribution of wavefunction coefficients through the proton-neutron entanglement entropy.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-motivation">Theoretical Motivation</h2>
<p>We can always expand a wavefunction into any basis. Suppose we have some initial representation of our wavefunction, <span class="math display">\[\label{eqn: decomp1}
    |\Psi\rangle=\sum_{i_p,j_p} \Psi_{i_p,j_n} |i_p\rangle|j_n\rangle,\]</span> where the uncoupled basis states are Slater determinants: <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    |i_p\rangle \textrm{ and }|j_n\rangle, 
\end{split}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i_p = 1, d_p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j_p = 1, d_n\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(d_p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_n\)</span> are the number of proton and neutron basis states, respectively.</p>
<p>We choose to decompose our wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> into pure proton <span class="math inline">\(|\pi_a\rangle\)</span> and pure neutron <span class="math inline">\(|\nu_b\rangle\)</span> wavefunctions which are related to the old basis by some unitary transformation, <span class="math display">\[\label{unitary}
    |\pi_a\rangle=\sum_{i_p}U_{ai_p}^\pi |i_p\rangle,\]</span> and similarly for <span class="math inline">\(|j_n\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\nu_b\rangle\)</span>. Thus we can find <span class="math display">\[\label{eqn: decomp2} \begin{split}
    |\Psi\rangle  =\sum_{a,b} \tilde{\Psi}_{ab}|\pi_a\rangle|\nu_b\rangle,
\end{split}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> enumerates proton single-particle states and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> enumerates neutron single-particle states. If the sum is taken over all states, (<a href="#eqn: decomp2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomp2">[eqn: decomp2]</a>) is equivalent to (<a href="#eqn: decomp1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomp1">[eqn: decomp1]</a>). The goal, however, is to find a basis in which the sum (<a href="#eqn: decomp2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomp2">[eqn: decomp2]</a>) can be truncated, thus reducing the size of the problem.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\label{eqn: decomptrunc}
|\Psi\rangle = \sum_{a,b = 1}^{N} \tilde{\Psi}_{ab}|\pi_a\rangle|\nu_b\rangle,\ \ N &lt;&lt; \min(d_p,d_n).\]</span> In order for the truncated sum to be useful, the terms we exclude must be small compared to the overall wavefunction. If we have some normalized representation of a wavefunction, <span class="math display">\[\label{refEE1}
    |\Psi\rangle = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha |\Phi_\alpha\rangle,\]</span> then the sum of the weights <span class="math inline">\(|c_\alpha|^2\)</span> is unity: <span class="math display">\[1 = \sum_\alpha|c_\alpha|^2,\]</span> and the distribution of the weights <span class="math inline">\(|c_i|^2\)</span> tells us how much the sum (<a href="#refEE1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="refEE1">[refEE1]</a>) can be truncated in the basis <span class="math inline">\({|\Phi_i\rangle}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In a basis of coupled single particle states as in (<a href="#eqn: decomp1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomp1">[eqn: decomp1]</a>), the coefficients form a non-symmetric matrix <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{i_p,j_n}\)</span>. However, it was shown in the studies cited above<span class="citation" data-cites="Papenbrock03 Papenbrock04 Papenbrock05"></span> that a singular value decomposition<span class="citation" data-cites="NumRec"></span> (SVD) of this matrix would transform <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{i_p,i_n}\)</span> into a diagonal matrix such that <span class="math display">\[\label{refEE2}
    |\Psi\rangle = \sum_i \gamma_i |\tilde{i_p}\rangle|\tilde{i_n}\rangle,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i=\tilde{\Psi}_{ii}\)</span> are the diagonal elements of the transformed matrix of <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{i_p,j_n}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(|\tilde{i_p}\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\tilde{i_n}\rangle\)</span> are some undetermined basis states. (See Appendix <a href="#appendix: svd" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="appendix: svd">9.4</a> or Chapter 3 for a more detailed explanation of singular value decompositions.) If such an expansion could be found, then, as for the simple case in (<a href="#refEE1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="refEE1">[refEE1]</a>), the distribution of expansion coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i\)</span> would tell us how much the expansion (<a href="#refEE2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="refEE2">[refEE2]</a>) could be truncated. The problem of course is determining the best basis, an as-yet unsolved problem. Nonetheless, there is still something to be learned from singular value decompositions. Just as eigenvalues are invariant under a change of basis, the “eigenvalues” <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i\)</span> are also invariant under a change of basis. (In fact these SVD eigenvalues and the SVD itself are generalizations of eigenvalue decompositions.) Therefore, we can compute the SVD eigenvalues of a known expansion, such as from the nuclear wavefunctions from an M-scheme method (e.g. BIGSTICK), and at the very least we can determine whether or not an truncation is possible.</p>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<p>I conduct two related studies: In Chapter 3, I will examine the distribution of nuclear wavefunction amplitudes, from which we extract the proton-neutron entanglement entropy. I provide evidence that the creation of approximate wavefunctions through coupling of proton and neutron wavefunctions may be a valuable method, and I test a postulate which predicts that this proton-neutron coupling scheme will be even more effective for nuclei where the number of neutrons is much larger than the number of protons, i.e. for large isospin. Chapter 3 also attempts to investigate the cause of this behavior via the entanglement entropy. Then in Chapter 4, I will decompose BIGSTICK wavefunctions into their pure-proton and pure-neutron components by projecting the existing wavefunctions onto the appropriate operators. This, I will argue, demonstrates directly that a truncated basis of coupled proton and neutron Slater determinants can accurately reproduce nuclear wavefunctions.</p>
<h1 id="chap:coupling">ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY</h1>
<p>In this chapter I will explain in detail the method we will use to generate evidence our nuclear wavefunctions can be significantly truncated. We will use the entanglement entropy of protons and neutrons (the entropy of entanglement between protons and neutrons) to do this.</p>
<p>The entanglement entropy is a way to quantify the distribution of wavefunction coefficients. Entanglement entropy pertains to bipartite systems, Hilbert spaces with more than one species of wavefunction that can be represented as an outer product of two or more subsystems. For us this means that our total Hilbert <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^{\pi\nu}\)</span> is the outer product of the subspace of many-proton states <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_\pi\)</span> with the subspace of many-neutron states <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_\nu\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{H}^{\pi\nu} = \mathcal{H}_\pi\otimes\mathcal{H}_\nu.\]</span> This is congruent with the fact that our basis states are written as outer products of proton and neutron Slater determinants. It will be shown that a wavefunction with zero proton-neutron entanglement entropy can be written with a single term in an expansion such as (<a href="#refEE2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="refEE2">[refEE2]</a>). To do this I will first explain how the proton-neutron entanglement entropy comes naturally out of a singular value decomposition of the coefficients of a wavefunction in a basis of coupled proton and neutron wavefunctions.</p>
<p>A singular value decomposition is a factorization of any matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into the following form: <span class="math display">\[A = UDV^\dagger,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> are unitary matrices and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are the SVD eigenvalues. See Appendix <a href="#appendix: svd" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="appendix: svd">9.4</a> for more information about singular value decompositions. The matrices don’t have to be square. Notice that if we compute <span class="math inline">\(AA^\dagger\)</span> we find: <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}\label{svd1}
    AA^\dagger &amp;=   UDV^\dagger   (UDV^\dagger)^\dagger\\
               &amp;=   UDV^\dagger    VD^\dagger U^\dagger \\
               &amp;=  UD D^\dagger U^\dagger,
\end{split}\]</span> where now <span class="math inline">\(D^\dagger D =D^2\)</span> is diagonal, square, and positive definite. The SVD eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i\)</span> can thus be obtained from the diagonal elements <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i^2\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(D^2\)</span> by diagonalizing <span class="math inline">\(AA^\dagger\)</span> . Since equation (<a href="#svd1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="svd1">[svd1]</a>) represents a unitary transformation of a matrix, the SVD eigenvalues are invariant. This means that the SVD eigenvalues of the coefficients in the expansion (<a href="#eqn: decomptrunc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomptrunc">[eqn: decomptrunc]</a>) can found by diagonalizing the matrix <span class="math display">\[\label{svd2}
    (AA^\dagger)_{a&#39;a}=\sum_b\Psi_{a&#39;b}\Psi^*_{ba},\]</span> from the coefficients in equation (<a href="#eqn: decomp1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomp1">[eqn: decomp1]</a>) which we can find from solutions in a known basis.</p>
<p>Equation (<a href="#svd2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="svd2">[svd2]</a>) is simply the reduced density matrix of the eigenstate <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> in the choice of basis given in (<a href="#eqn: decomp1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomp1">[eqn: decomp1]</a>). The <em>density operator</em> of a pure state <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[\rho = |\Psi\rangle\langle \Psi|.\]</span> Given the choice of basis shown in equation (<a href="#eqn: decomp1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: decomp1">[eqn: decomp1]</a>), we can compute the following density matrix: <span class="math display">\[\label{rhoall}
    \rho_{a&#39;b&#39;ab} = {\Psi}_{a&#39;b&#39;}{\Psi}^*_{ba}.\]</span></p>
<p>If the Hilbert space is bipartite <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^{\pi\nu} = \mathcal{H}^\pi \otimes \mathcal{H}^\nu\)</span> then we can define the reduced density operator of a particular subspace <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^\pi\)</span> to be the trace over the conjugate subspace <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^\nu\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\rho^\pi = tr_\nu \rho^{\pi\nu},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\pi\nu}\)</span> is a density operator in the space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^{\pi\nu}\)</span> and the trace operator <span class="math inline">\(tr_\nu\)</span> contracts the indices belonging to the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^\nu\)</span> Hilbert space. The reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho^\pi\)</span> in our choice of basis is computed from (<a href="#rhoall" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="rhoall">[rhoall]</a>): <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}\label{matprod}
    \rho_{a&#39;a}^{\pi} &amp;= \sum_{b&#39;b}\delta_{b&#39;b} (\rho_{a&#39;b&#39;ab}) \\
        &amp;=\sum_b {\Psi}_{a&#39;b}{\Psi}^*_{ba}\\
        &amp;=(AA^\dagger)_{a&#39;a}.
\end{split}\]</span> In the SVD papers cited earlier, this density matrix was only used to compute the SVD eigenvalues. Here, we are going to take advantage of the information of mixing that is contained within the density matrix: the entanglement entropy.</p>
<p>The <em>von Neumann entropy</em> is defined in terms of the generalized density operator (quantum state <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>) by <span class="math display">\[S(\rho) \equiv -tr(\rho\ \ln\rho).\]</span> The <em>entanglement entropy</em> of a state in a bipartite system <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^{\pi\nu} = \mathcal{H}^\pi \otimes \mathcal{H}^\nu\)</span> is the von Neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix: <span class="math display">\[S(\rho^\pi) = -tr(\rho^\pi \ln \rho^\pi).\]</span> In our case, the proton-neutron entanglement entropy measures the number of quantum bits shared between the proton and neutron spaces. It is also a measure of the distribution of the SVD eigenvalues. It can be shown that <span class="math inline">\(S(\rho^\pi)=S(\rho^\nu)\)</span>, from the invariance of SVD eigenvalues. We therefore simply refer to <span class="math inline">\(S_{pn}\equiv S(\rho^\pi)=S(\rho^\nu)\)</span> as the proton-neutron entanglement entropy. We first diagonalize the density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_\pi\)</span> and compute <span class="math inline">\(S_{pn}\)</span> using the eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\{\gamma_i^2\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_\pi\)</span> so that <span class="math display">\[S_{pn} = -\sum_i \gamma_i^2\ \ln(\gamma_i^2),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i\)</span> are also the SVD eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Psi_{ab}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{i_pj_n}\)</span>. The proton-neutron entanglement entropy for a given state <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> is a measure of the entanglement of the two partitions of the Hilbert space. It indicates the degree to which an expansion <span class="math display">\[\label{diag}
    |\Psi\rangle = \sum_i \gamma_i |\tilde{\pi}_i\rangle|\tilde{\nu}_i\rangle\]</span> can be truncated. If the entanglement entropy is zero, then (<a href="#diag" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="diag">[diag]</a>) contains only one term. A maximal value of <span class="math inline">\(S_{pn}\)</span> would indicate that each term in the expansion is equally weighted; then we would have <span class="math display">\[S_{max} = \ln(d_p).\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s consider a bipartite spin system <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_{12}=\mathcal{H}_1\otimes
\mathcal{H}_2\)</span> to illustrate this. We can represent any wavefunction in this space as <span class="math display">\[\label{matrepres}
    |\Psi\rangle=\sum_{ab}\Psi_{ab}|a\rangle\otimes|b\rangle\to \underline{\Psi} =
    \begin{bmatrix} \Psi_{\uparrow\uparrow}&amp;\Psi_{\uparrow\downarrow}\\ 
    \Psi_{\downarrow\uparrow}&amp;\Psi_{\downarrow\downarrow}\end{bmatrix},\]</span> where the basis vectors <span class="math inline">\(|a\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|b\rangle\)</span> are either <span class="math inline">\(|\uparrow\rangle\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|\downarrow\rangle\)</span>, and where the elements of the matrix <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\Psi}\)</span> are the coefficients for the four possible bipartite basis states. Let’s compute the entanglement entropy for two spin-1/2 particles which are not entangled: <span class="math display">\[\label{noentangle}
    |\Psi\rangle=|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle\to\underline{\Psi}=\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;1\\0&amp;0\end{bmatrix}.\]</span> The reduced density matrix of this wavefunction can be computed as the matrix product <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\Psi}*\underline{\Psi}^\dagger\)</span> (see equation (<a href="#matprod" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="matprod">[matprod]</a>)): <span class="math display">\[\underline{\rho}_1 = \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;1\\0&amp;0\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}0&amp;0\\1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;0\end{bmatrix}.\]</span> This density matrix is already diagonal, so we can compute its von Neummann entropy as <span class="math display">\[S_{12}=S(\rho_1) = -(1\ln(1)+0\ln(0)) = 0.\]</span> Thus a non-entangled pair of spin-1/2 particles has zero entanglement entropy.</p>
<p>We can follow the same procedure for an entangled pair: <span class="math display">\[\label{maxentangle}
    |\Psi&#39;\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle-|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle),\]</span> which can be represented as a matrix using (<a href="#matrepres" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="matrepres">[matrepres]</a>): <span class="math display">\[\underline{\Psi&#39;} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}0&amp;1\\-1&amp;0\end{bmatrix}.\]</span> The reduced density matrix is <span class="math display">\[\underline{\rho&#39;}=\underline{\Psi&#39;}*\underline{\Psi&#39;}^\dagger=\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;1\end{bmatrix}.\]</span> Thus this entangled pair has an entanglement entropy <span class="math display">\[S_{12}=S(\rho_1)=-(\frac{1}{2}\ln(\frac{1}{2})+\frac{1}{2}\ln(\frac{1}{2}))=\ln 2,\]</span> which is the maximum entanglement entropy for a bipartite system with two-dimensional subspaces.</p>
<p>A lower proton-neutron entanglement entropy corresponds to a system in which we can obtain a more accurate representation of our state <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> with fewer states in (<a href="#diag" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="diag">[diag]</a>). The proton-neutron entanglement entropy has an advantage over the raw distribution of SVD values because we can use it to compare multiple states with a single number. In particular, if the proton-neutron entanglement entropy is smaller in nuclei where isospin is large, then we can expect such a truncation scheme to be more effective for large isospin nuclei. This is good news for the calculation of large nuclei with a large excess of neutrons. Cesium 133 has <span class="math inline">\(40\%\)</span> more neutrons than protons, for example. However, and this is critical, we do not yet have a criterion to find the optimal basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|\tilde{\pi}_i\rangle|\tilde{\nu}_i\rangle\}\)</span>, we are only generating evidence that one exists.</p>
<p>We will compute the proton-neutron entanglement entropy and demonstrate that it is significantly lower for <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei than for <span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span> nuclei, even for nuclei with the same model space dimensions. First I will justify the use of low proton-neutron entanglement entropy as an indicator of the existence of a basis which can yield accurate truncated representations.</p>
<h3 id="particle-hole-conjugates">Particle-Hole Conjugates</h3>
<p>The proton-neutron entanglement entropy depends on the dimension of the model space. In order for the proton-neutron entanglement entropy to be useful in comparing different nuclei, we need cases with equal or similar dimensionality. To do this, we choose to compare particle-hole conjugates.</p>
<p>In the interacting shell model, we reduce the effective size of the Hilbert space by redefining the vacuum state to be some inert core of nucleons, above which is a system of interacting particles. Some interacting shell model codes can also carry out “particle hole conjugation”<span class="citation" data-cites="Brussard Heyde"></span>, where a system of particles can be described instead by a system of holes. A hole is a gap in an otherwise filled shell. The number of valence particles is restricted to some maximum value and a filled particle state is mathematically equivalent to a hole. If a nucleus has fewer holes than particles in a model space, it is preferable to model it as a system of interacting holes. Two nuclei which are particle-hole conjugates in a model space have an equal number of proton particles and/or proton holes, and an equal number of neutron particles and/or neutron holes.</p>
<p>Consider the following example: <span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>F in the <em>sd</em>-shell (<span class="math inline">\(0d_{3/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0d_{5/2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1s_{1/2}\)</span>) has 8 inert protons and 8 inert neutrons, with one valence proton and one valence neutron, both of which are in the <span class="math inline">\(0d_{3/2}\)</span> single particle orbit. The sd-shell model space has a maximum of 12 valence particles of each type, since the space (<span class="math inline">\(0d_{3/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0d_{5/2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1s_{1/2}\)</span>) has 12 unique quantum numbers in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>F has 12 possible states each for the proton and neutron. <span class="math inline">\(^{38}\)</span>K, which has 11 valence protons and 11 valence neutrons, can be represented by two particle holes in the completely filled <em>sd</em>-shell model space, and thus also has 12 possible states. <span>Table <a href="#table: sd.spo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="table: sd.spo">1.2</a></span> contains the complete set of sd-shell model space quantum numbers.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#tbl: log" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tbl: log">3.1</a> is a collection of nuclei for which the proton-neutron entanglement entropy of the ground state were computed. Each row in the table is a particle-hole conjugate triplet, meaning every nucleus is listed in the same row as its particle-hole conjugates. For example, <span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>F, <span class="math inline">\(^{28}\)</span>F, and <span class="math inline">\(^{38}\)</span>K are particle-hole conjugates . The numbers to the right of each nuclide are the number of valence protons (<span class="math inline">\(Z_{val}\)</span>) and valence neutrons (<span class="math inline">\(N_{val}\)</span>), respectively, in each nuclide’s respective shell model space.</p>

For example, the data points above <span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>F on the horizontal axis are <span class="math inline">\(^{18}\)</span>F (<span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(^{28}\)</span>F (<span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(^{38}\)</span>K (<span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span>).

<h3 id="excited-states-and-thermalization">Excited States and Thermalization</h3>
<p>In order for our approach to be viable, we will need the pattern exhibited in the previous sections to hold for not just the ground state, but for excited states as well. By plotting the proton-neutron entanglement entropy for a number of the lowest energy levels, we see that <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei tend to have the lowest proton-neutron entanglement entropies only for the first few lowest eigenstates. After this, the ordering becomes apparently random. We came to the conclusion that we are observing a kind of thermalization. As the energy of the system increases, the low entropy configurations expressed in <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei disappear. An example is given in Figure <a href="#smglvl" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="smglvl">3.2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-and-isospin">Entropy and Isospin</h3>
<p>So far we have demonstrated on a case by case basis that <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei tend to have lower proton-neutron entanglement entropy than their particle-hole conjugates. The next kind of plot that we examine are plots of proton-neutron entanglement entropy <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> versus isospin, specifically the z-component of the isospin <span class="math inline">\(T_z\)</span>. We will use the convention that for protons <span class="math inline">\(T_z=-\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and that for neutrons <span class="math inline">\(T_z=+\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. We can then compute the maximum value of <span class="math inline">\(T_z\)</span> for a given nucleus as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}(N-Z)\)</span>. As shown in Figures <a href="#fig: tz1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig: tz1">3.3</a> as <span class="math inline">\(T_z\)</span> increases, the proton-neutron entanglement entropy tends to decrease. This was shown in both the <em>sd</em> shell and the <em>pf</em> shell. We also extended the analysis to the sd-pf shell model space where we examined non physical nuclei with value of <span class="math inline">\(T_z\)</span> as high as <span class="math inline">\(T_z=14\)</span>.</p>
<p>In Figure <a href="#fig: tz1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig: tz1">3.3</a>, we see that odd-odd nuclei (nuclei with odd numbers of protons and neutrons) have especially high proton-neutron entanglement. We hypothesize that this is due to the pairing interaction, which describes a tendency for pairs of nucleons to preferentially couple to <span class="math inline">\(J=0\)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="Brussard"></span>. In odd-odd nuclei, one proton and one neutron are left unpaired, and it is thus thought that the pairing interaction leads to an increased interaction between these unpaired nucleons and therefore a higher proton-neutron entanglement entropy.</p>

<h3 id="dialing-the-strength-of-the-proton-neutron-interaction">Dialing the Strength of the Proton-Neutron Interaction</h3>
<p>The shell-model code BIGSTICK to allows for scaling of the proton-neutron interaction term when working in the explicit proton-neutron formalism. Thus the two-body part of Hamiltonian is of the form <span class="math display">\[H = H_{pp} + H_{nn} + \lambda H_{pn}.\]</span> In BIGSTICK, this means scaling the two-body interaction matrix elements by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\lambda\langle ab|V^{(pn)}|cd\rangle\]</span> We examined the relationship between the strength of the proton-neutron interaction and the relative proton-neutron entanglement entropy for the ground state of a number of nuclei. (See Figure <a href="#fig: l28ne" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig: l28ne">3.4</a>.) The scaling factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> was varied from zero, i.e. no proton-neutron interaction at all, to an order of magnitude above unity. A scaling factor of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=1\)</span> is a fully realistic calculation. The entanglement entropy will be zero when <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is zero because in this case there is no interaction between protons and neutrons. Essentially we have two separate and non-interacting model spaces. The entanglement entropy will increase as the strength of the interaction increases.</p>
<p>If our hypothesis that <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei converge faster in the proton-neutron formalism than <span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span> nuclei is correct, then we might expect different behavior in the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> curves for <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span> nuclei. In fact what we find is that the <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> curve for <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei falls below the one for <span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span> nuclei for nuclei of the same model space dimension. Having the same model space dimension means that the two nuclei will also have the same maximum proton-neutron entanglement entropy. This is accomplished by comparing nuclei which are particle-hole conjugates.</p>

<h2 id="modified-nuclear-interactions">Modified Nuclear Interactions</h2>
<p>We have shown that proton-neutron entanglement entropy is inversely correlated with isospin; however it is not obvious why this is the case. In this section I summarize some of the attempts made to isolate the physics responsible for the behavior demonstrated in the previous chapter. To this end, I recomputed the entanglement entropy versus proton-neutron interaction strength (via the scaling factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) for several different nucleon-nucleon interactions.</p>
<p>The first series of calculations were made with <em>zero single particle energies</em>. In this interaction we start with the fully realistic nuclear interaction and then set the single particle energies equal to zero. In the many-body Hamiltonian, <span class="math display">\[H = \sum_{ij} \epsilon_{ij}a^\dagger_ia_i + \sum_{ijkl} a^\dagger_ia^\dagger_jV_{ijkl}a_ka_l\]</span> the single particle energies are <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ij}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The second series of calculations were made with <em>traceless interactions</em> (see Figure <a href="#fignmp" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fignmp">3.5</a>). In this interaction we again start with the fully realistic nuclear interaction and then remove the monopole terms in the two-body interaction. These are terms of the form<span class="citation" data-cites="Caurier"></span> <span class="math display">\[V_{mono} = \sum_{ab} \hat{n}_a(\hat{n}_b-\delta_{ab})U(ab),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}\)</span> are number operators. These are related to shell structure.</p>
<p>The third series of calculations were made with only an attractive quadrupole-quadrupole interaction<span class="citation" data-cites="Schuck"></span> (see Figure <a href="#figqq" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="figqq">3.6</a>). This interaction is derived from the nuclear quadrupole moment<span class="citation" data-cites="Wong Schuck"></span>, <span class="math display">\[Q_{ij}=\int \rho(\vec{r})(3x_ix_j-r^2\delta_{id})d\vec{r},\]</span> a tensor operator for which for microscopic expectation value for a system of nuclear matter is given by<span class="citation" data-cites="Heyde Schuck"></span> <span class="math display">\[Q_\alpha(J,M) = \langle \psi_{JM}(r_i)|\sum_i(3x^\alpha_i-r_i^2)|\psi_{JM}(r_i)\rangle,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the directional orientation of the quadrupole moment of interest.</p>
<p>The fourth series of calculations were made with an attractive pairing interaction (see Figure <a href="#figpair" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="figpair">3.7</a>). A problem arose when computing entanglement entropies for this interaction. The pairing interaction is known to be highly degenerate, and in cases where the eigenstates are nearly degenerate, the Lanczos method performs poorly. This is because the Lanczos method is susceptible to loss of orthogonality of eigenstates due to numerical noise. In order to counteract this, the two-body interaction matrix elements were slightly modified. A very small random interaction was added to the matrix elements in order to desensitize the Lanczos algorithm to the degeneracies.</p>

<p>We also ran several trials with particle-hole conjugate nuclei with random two-body interactions (see Figure <a href="#figrand1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="figrand1">3.8</a> and Figure <a href="#figrand2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="figrand2">3.9</a>). This means that all of the physics is removed and all that remains are properties of the model space. Because any given random interaction may not be particularly enlightening, we ran up to 1000 calculations with unique random interactions and plotted a histogram of the ground state entanglement entropy. In these calculations we lose the correlation between isospin and proton-neutron entanglement entropy. We often see normal distributions of the entanglement entropy for a given nucleus, and two unique modes for the distributions within a particle-hole conjugate triplet.</p>

<h2 id="toy-model">Toy Model</h2>
<p>I constructed a toy model to investigate the behavior of entanglement entropy of coupled systems, in an attempt to better understand the behavior seen in real nuclei such as in Figure <a href="#fig: l28ne" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig: l28ne">3.4</a>. In the toy model, I consider a subspace A and a subspace B, which together form a bipartite system <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_{AB}=\mathcal{H}_A\otimes\mathcal{H}_B\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_{AB}\)</span> is spanned by a coupled basis: <span class="math display">\[|i\rangle = |a\rangle|b\rangle = |a\rangle\otimes |b\rangle,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(|a\rangle\)</span> are the basis states of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|b\rangle\)</span> are the basis states of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_B\)</span>. A Hamiltonian operator of this bipartite space could be written as <span class="math display">\[\hat{H} = \hat{H}_A + \hat{H}_B + \hat{H}_{AB}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_A =\hat{h}_a \otimes \hat{1}\)</span> is an operator which acts purely in the A space, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_B=\hat{1}\otimes\hat{h}_b\)</span> is an operator which acts purely in the B space and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{AB}=\hat{V}\otimes\hat{W}\)</span> is an operator which acts on both spaces. We are interested in the behavior of the system as a function of the strength of the coupling term <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{AB}\)</span>. I assume for convenience that we have already diagonalized <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_B\)</span>. I choose single particle spaces with constant energy spacing: <span class="math display">\[E_a \equiv \hat{h}_A |a\rangle = a \epsilon\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(a=1,..,N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = const.\)</span>, and similarly for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_B\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{AB}\)</span> I choose an operator which is the tensor product of an operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{V}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_A\)</span> and an operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{W}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_B\)</span>. I am only interested in the behavior of the system as a function of the strength of the interaction between the subsystems, so the exact structure of each subsystem is not important. Therefore, I simply choose to fill these two matrices with a random Gaussian number generator. I symmetrically fill an <span class="math inline">\(N\times N\)</span> matrix with random numbers centered at zero with a standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(2\sigma\)</span> for the diagonal matrix elements, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for the off-diagonal matrix, a standard practice for generating real, symmetric random matrices. Finally, I include a two-body matrix elements (TBME) scaling factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{AB} = \lambda\hat{V}\otimes \hat{W}\]</span> It is now straightforward to calculate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian. As above, let <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a&#39;\)</span> label the proton states and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b&#39;\)</span> label the neutron states. These run from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Now let <span class="math inline">\(i = a + N(b-1)\)</span> label the many-body state, which runs from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(N^2\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:1}
	\langle i&#39;|\hat{H}|i\rangle =     
	H_{i&#39;,i} = \delta_{a&#39;a}\delta_{b&#39;b}(E_a+E_b)+\lambda V_{a&#39;a} W_{b&#39;b}.\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(V_{a&#39;a}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W_{b&#39;b}\)</span> are real, symmetric, <span class="math inline">\(N \times N\)</span> random matrices with Gaussian distributions: <span class="math display">\[P(V_{aa&#39;}) \sim exp\Big(-\frac{V_{aa&#39;}^2}{2\sigma^2(1+\delta_{a&#39;a})}\Big),\]</span> a Gaussian distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for the off-diagonals and <span class="math inline">\(2\sigma\)</span> for the diagonals.</p>
<p>Once we diagonalize the model Hamiltonian, we want to quantify how the entanglement entropy is affected by the coupling- term scaling factor <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and by the two interactions are the same <span class="math inline">\(W=V\)</span> or different <span class="math inline">\(W\neq V\)</span>. This is meant to model the behavior of the nuclear Hamiltonian when and its distinct <span class="math inline">\(S_{pn}\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> curves for when the number of protons is the same or different from the number of neutrons.</p>
<p>Suppose that we diagonalize the Hamiltonian and that <span class="math display">\[\hat{H} |\psi\rangle_i = E_i |\psi\rangle_i\]</span> defines our <span class="math inline">\(N^2\)</span> eigenstates. Any given state can be written as <span class="math display">\[|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle = \sum_{a,b} c_{ab} |a\rangle|b\rangle,\]</span> and so the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> is the partial trace, <span class="math display">\[\rho_A = tr_a\ \rho.\]</span> Given our choice of indexing, this is computed as <span class="math display">\[\rho_p(a&#39;,a) = \sum_{b=1}^N c_{a&#39;b}c_{ab}^*.\]</span> We can now define the proton-neutron entanglement entropy of the state described by <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> to be the <em>von Neumann</em> entropy of the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_p\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[S_{pn} = -tr \rho_p\ \ln \rho_p.\]</span> If we first diagonalize <span class="math inline">\(\rho_p\)</span> to find its <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_i^2\)</span> then the entanglement entropy becomes <span class="math display">\[S_{pn} = - \sum_{i=1}^N \gamma_i^2\ \ln \gamma_i^2.\]</span> This quantity measures the entanglement entropy, or the mixing of quantum bits, of the two subspaces in a given state of the Hamiltonian.</p>
<p>In the first adaption of this toy model we has Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly as they appear in equation (<a href="#eq:1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:1">[eq:1]</a>). Here, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=1\)</span>, and two curves are plotted: one in which the random matrices <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are the same and one in which they are different. In these models we saw that when the two interactions <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> are the same, the entanglement entropy tends towards some finite non-zero value, whereas when <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> are different, the entanglement entropy falls off to zero. This tells us that the entanglement entropy can differ between two systems of the same dimension depending on the similarity of the interactions acting between the subspaces. Mathematically this has to do with the orthogonality of the eigenstates of the interactions within each subspace. In another adaption of the model, we start with two identical subspaces and then slowly change one of the subspaces to be different from the original. <span class="math display">\[\label{modeld}
	H = E^V + E^W + \lambda(V\otimes(V+\delta W))\]</span> In doing so we can see in Figure <a href="#opt3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="opt3">3.10</a> that as the two interactions diverge, the entanglement entropy of the system falls off from its maximum convergent value. When the perturbative parameter <span class="math inline">\(\delta=0\)</span>, equation (<a href="#modeld" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="modeld">[modeld]</a>) reduces to equation (<a href="#eq:1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:1">[eq:1]</a>) for the case when <span class="math inline">\(W=V\)</span>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In an attempt to get convergence to non-zero entanglement entropies when <span class="math inline">\(W\neq V\)</span>, which is what we see in the nuclear calculations, I suggested the following Hamiltonian on the grounds that a constant term may prevent the entanglement entropy from converging to zero when the two species of interactions are different: <span class="math display">\[H_{i&#39;,i} = \delta_{a&#39;a}\delta_{b&#39;b}(E_a+E_b)+\lambda
\big( V_{a&#39;a} W_{b&#39;b} + V_{a&#39;a} + W_{b&#39;b} \big ),\]</span> which implicitly is a Hamiltonian of the form <span class="math display">\[H = E^V + E^W + \lambda ( V\otimes W + V\otimes I + I \otimes W ),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is diagonal. By using an explicitly non-separable interaction, we obtained the desirable feature than <span class="math inline">\(W\neq V\)</span> curves converged to non-zero entanglement entropy. However, curves generated with different random number generator seeds produced varying results, some exhibiting anomalous spikes in entropy near the origin.</p>
<p>The next most obvious adaption was to simply include a several terms in the coupling part of the Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[H_{i&#39;,i} = \delta_{a&#39;a}\delta_{b&#39;b}(E_a+E_b)+\lambda\big( 
\sum_i V_{a&#39;a}^i W_{b&#39;b}^i  \big ),\]</span> which is a Hamiltonian of the form: <span class="math display">\[H = E^{(V)} + E^{(W)} + \lambda (\sum_i V_i \otimes W_i ),\]</span> where each The results of this toy model are shown in Figure <a href="#best" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="best">[best]</a>. This version of the toy model has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Entanglement entropy goes to zero at the origin</p></li>
<li><p>Dependence on the random number generator seed goes down with the number of terms in the sum</p></li>
<li><p>Entanglement entropy convergences to nonzero entanglement entropies at large <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> for different subspaces, and</p></li>
<li><p>Very few anomalous features, such as spikes in entanglement entropy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, the model still doesn’t have the same features as the realistic proton-neutron entanglement entropy, namely, symmetric entanglement entropy curves when the both species’ interactions are identical, and, when the interactions are different: lower entanglement entropy for positive <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and higher entanglement entropy for negative <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. See Figure <a href="#best" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="best">[best]</a> (a) and (b) for comparison. Several dozen other toy model Hamiltonians were investigated, including those with different single species interactions, and models with different dimensions. However, I failed to find a model which reliably produces <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> curves with the same topology as in the nuclear Hamiltonian.</p>
<h2 id="summary-on-entanglement-entropy">Summary on Entanglement Entropy</h2>
<p>We investigated the properties of the proton-neutron entanglement entropy, which is an indicator used to determine whether or not certain wavefunctions could be represented more efficiently in some basis. We showed that nuclei with unequal numbers of protons and neutrons have a lower entanglement entropy, which means that <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei may have even more efficient representations. We attempted to understand the properties of the entanglement entropy, but more investigation is needed. The toy model we investigated tells us that the phenomenon of higher entanglement entropy in systems with identical subspaces is more ubiquitous than the nuclear many-body problem. Moving on from this section, readers should keep in mind that we have evidence for the existence of efficient representations of our nuclear wavefunctions, but have yet to inquire about which basis will yield these efficient representations. This will be addressed in the next chapter.</p>
<h1 id="chap:decomp">PROTON-NEUTRON DECOMPOSITION</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we studied the distribution of wavefunction coefficients in order to provide evidence that there exists a basis in which our nuclear wavefunctions could be truncated, thus allowing more efficient representation of the wavefunctions. Ultimately our goal is to find a basis in which our Hamiltonian can be truncated. In this chapter I will examine a decomposition of wavefunctions which corresponds to a particular framework for computing truncated Hamiltonian matrix elements.</p>
<p>We will be assuming that our Hamiltonian can be decomposed as <span class="math display">\[\label{htotal}
	\hat{H} = \hat{H}_{proton} + \hat{H}_{neutron} + \hat{H}_{proton-neutron}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{proton}\)</span> contains all interactions between protons, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{neutron}\)</span> contains all interactions between neutrons, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{proton-neutron}\)</span> contains all remaining interactions between protons and neutrons. Then we call the eigenstates of the pure-proton Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(|\pi\rangle\)</span>, as in <span class="math display">\[\label{hppp}
	H_{proton}|\pi\rangle = E_p|\pi\rangle,\]</span> and the eigenstates of the pure-neutron Hamiltonian are equivalently define for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{neutron}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\nu\rangle\)</span>. Roughly speaking, our proposed truncation scheme is to compute the full Hamiltonian (<a href="#htotal" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="htotal">[htotal]</a>) in a basis built up from the coupled eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{proton}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{neutron}\)</span>. It was therefore worth decomposing existing wavefunctions <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> into the eigenstates of both pure-proton interaction operators and pure-neutron interaction operators. This will tell us how whether or not truncating a basis of coupled pure-proton and pure-neutron wavefunctions will be viable. To see why, consider an arbitrary wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span>. To expand <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> into a basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|\alpha\rangle\}\)</span>, one first computes the coefficients <span class="math display">\[c_\alpha = \langle \alpha|\Psi\rangle.\]</span> If some significant subset of the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\{|\alpha\rangle\}\)</span> are much smaller than the rest, then the full wavefunction, <span class="math display">\[|\Psi\rangle = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha |\alpha\rangle,\]</span> could be represented by just a few terms. What we care about is the magnitude of the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\{|\alpha\rangle\}\)</span>, thus we could instead compute <span class="math display">\[\label{coef2}
    |c_\alpha|^2 = \langle \Psi|\alpha\rangle\langle \alpha|\Psi\rangle,\]</span> where the object <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha\rangle\langle \alpha|\)</span> is a projection operator.</p>
<p>We computed the equivalent set of coefficients (<a href="#coef2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="coef2">[coef2]</a>) for our nuclear wavefunctions projected onto the eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{proton}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{neutron}\)</span>. This was done using existing capabilities in BIGSTICK to compute transition strength functions. In particular I used the option to decompose wavefunctions onto scalar operators<span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson18"></span>. To do this, we first solve for the wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> for some nucleus. Then BIGSTICK solves equation (<a href="#hppp" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="hppp">[hppp]</a>) and the equivalent equation for the neutron Hamiltonian, using its Lanczos capabilities to find low-lying eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(|\pi_a\rangle\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(|\nu_a\rangle\)</span>). Then, the nuclear wavefunction is projected onto these eigenstates in the following manner: <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
	\langle \pi_a|\Psi\rangle &amp;= \langle \pi_a|\sum_{a,b}\tilde{\Psi}_{ab}|\pi_a\rangle|\nu_b\rangle \\
		              &amp;= \sum_{b}\tilde{\Psi}_{ab}|\nu_b\rangle.
\end{split}\]</span> The strengths of these projections is then computed as <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
        \langle \Psi|\pi_a&#39;\rangle\langle \pi_a|\Psi\rangle &amp;= \sum_b \tilde{\Psi}^*_{a&#39;b}\tilde{\Psi}_{ab} \\
 		&amp;= \sum_b^{N_{keep}} |\Psi_{ab}|^2\\
        &amp; \equiv c_a^2.
\end{split}\]</span> The quantities <span class="math inline">\(c_a^2\)</span> are the strengths of the projection of a wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> onto the proton-proton interaction eigenstate <span class="math inline">\(|\pi_a\rangle\)</span>. Since we are assuming a set of normalized wavefunctions in our basis, <span class="math display">\[1 = \sum_a \langle \pi_a|\pi_a\rangle,\]</span> and thus the strengths <span class="math inline">\(c_a^2\)</span> are the fractions of the total wavefuntion <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> contained in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\pi_a\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>I projected nuclear wavefunctions onto the eigenstates of the proton Hamiltonian of the neutron Hamiltonian and plotted the strengths <span class="math inline">\(c_X^2\)</span> for each interaction as a function of the eigenstate number. A typical set of results in shown in Figure <a href="#fig: pndecomp1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig: pndecomp1">4.1</a> and Figure <a href="#fig: pndecomp2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig: pndecomp2">4.2</a>. The vertical axis is the strength of the decomposition onto the eigenstate of either the proton Hamiltonian or the neutron Hamiltonian with the <span class="math inline">\(X^{th}\)</span> lowest energy. Each plots has two sets of values, one for each of two particle-hole conjugate nuclei in the <em>sd</em>-shell: one being the proton (PP) decomposition and the other being the neutron (NN) decomposition.</p>
<p>There are two important conclusions to be drawn from these decompositions. The first is that the strengths fall off rapidly in the first handful of states. This suggests than a truncation of the coupled pure-proton and pure-neutron eigenstates could a viable method for obtaining approximate wavefunctions. However it is already known that this is the case for light nuclei<span class="citation" data-cites="Papenbrock03 Papenbrock04 Papenbrock05"></span>. The second important feature is apparent when plotting the strength function decompositions for particle-hole conjugate nuclei on the same plot. We find that even though these pairs of nuclei have the same dimensions in their shell model spaces, nuclei for which <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> have strengths which are significantly lower than their <span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span> conjugates. This is further evidence that the same proposed truncation scheme may be even more effective in heavier nuclei where <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span>.</p>

<h1 id="chap:PNISM">PNISM</h1>
<p>Finally, we turn to the main subject of this thesis, our Proton-Neutron Interacting Shell Model (PNISM) code. We are motivated by the results of the previous chapters; it is known that SVD eigenvalues of wavefunction coefficients fall off exponentially, and we have seen that they fall off even faster in nuclei with unequal numbers of protons and neutrons. We also argued that the basis states formed from the eigenstates of the proton interaction and the neutron interaction could likely allow for truncated wavefunctions. We have reason to believe that truncation of the model space in a weakly coupled proton-neutron basis might be an especially effective approximation for heavier nuclei with more neutrons than protons. We set out to write a code that couples together eigenstates of the proton Hamiltonian and eigenstates of the neutron Hamiltonian to create a many-proton many-neutron basis. The matrix elements of the full Hamiltonian are then computed in this basis, which is truncated.</p>
<p>This chapter will derive the equations used to carry out the calculation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements from the eigenstates computed by the interacting shell model code BIGSTICK. Calculation of the one-body density matrices of the resulting wavefunctions is also discussed. The following chapter will discuss the details of the code itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-hamiltonian">The Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>We write the nuclear Hamiltonian in explicit proton-neutron formalism. The Hamiltonian operator in the second quantization formalism, <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}=\sum_{ab}\langle a|T|b\rangle\hat{c}^\dagger_a\hat{c}_b
    +\frac{1}{4}\sum_{abcd}\langle ab|V|cd\rangle\hat{c}^\dagger_a\hat{c}^\dagger_b\hat{c}_c\hat{c}_d,\]</span> can be written as a sum of terms separated by nucleon species<span class="citation" data-cites="Johnson13"></span>: <span class="math display">\[\label{sep}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_p + \hat{H}_n + \hat{H}_{pp} + \hat{H}_{nn} + \hat{H}_{pn},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{pp}\)</span> are one- and two-body Hamiltonians, respectively, which act only on protons, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{nn}\)</span> act only on neutrons, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{pn}\)</span> contains the remaining interactions between proton and neutrons.

\end{split}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_{ab}\equiv\sqrt{(1+\delta_{ab})}\)</span>. Our next move is to change to an explicit proton-neutron decomposition. This can be done by using the states <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
(|\pi\nu\rangle-|\nu\pi\rangle)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}(|\pi\nu\rangle+|\nu\pi\rangle)\)</span>,<span class="math inline">\(|\pi\pi\rangle\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(|\nu\nu\rangle\)</span> to isolate operators by the nucleon species on which they act. The result is the following proton-proton two-body interaction: <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    \hat{H}_{pp} =
    \frac{1}{4}\sum_{abcd}\zeta_{ab}\zeta_{cd}
    \sum_{J}V_{J}^{pp}(ab,cd)\sum_{M}\hat{A}^\dagger_{JM}(a_\pi b_\pi)\hat{A}_{JM}(c_\pi d_\pi).
\end{split}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{nn}\)</span> has the same form. We will not use these directly but it is useful to see how the interaction is separated. The proton-neutron interaction is the only term that will be used directly in our code: <span class="math display">\[\label{eqn: hpn}
    H_{pn} = \sum_{abcd}\sum_J V_J^{(pn)}(ab,cd) 
\sum_M A_{JM}^\dagger(a_\pi b_\nu) A_{JM}(c_\pi d_\nu).\]</span></p>
<h2 id="the-basis">The Basis</h2>
<p>We have a Hamiltonian of the form (<a href="#sep" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sep">[sep]</a>) and in order to compute its matrix elements, we need to choose a basis, one which we hope we can truncate effectively. In this section I will explain our choice of basis and how we select which states to truncate. In the future we will want to develop a more sophisticated approximation scheme to improve our results. For now we first solve <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}\label{ppnnsol}
    (\hat{H}_p + \hat{H}_{pp})|\Psi_p\rangle&amp;= E_p|\Psi_p\rangle \textrm{ and}\\
    (\hat{H}_n+H_{nn})|\Psi_n\rangle&amp;=E_n|\Psi_n\rangle,
\end{split}\]</span> and set our uncoupled basis states equal to the solutions: <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}\label{plusminus}
    |J_p^{\pi_p},\alpha_p\rangle&amp;=|\Psi_p\rangle,\\
    |J_n^{\pi_n},\beta_n\rangle&amp;=|\Psi_n\rangle,
\end{split}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(J_p\)</span> is the total angular momentum of the proton state, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_p\)</span> is its parity, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_p\)</span> is just a state label, and equivalently for the neutron states. We build our many-body basis states by coupling together these proton and neutron states: <span class="math display">\[\label{cbasis}
	|J_p^{\pi_p},\alpha_p\rangle\otimes|J_n^{\pi_n},\beta_n\rangle.\]</span></p>
<p>Our solutions to (<a href="#ppnnsol" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ppnnsol">[ppnnsol]</a>) yield <span class="math inline">\(d_\pi\)</span> pure proton eigenstates and <span class="math inline">\(d_\pi\)</span> pure neutron eigenstates. The eigenstates of a Hermitian operator form a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors. Assuming these are normalized, any many-body wavefunction can be expanded: <span class="math display">\[|\Psi\rangle = \sum_{\alpha_p}^{d_\pi}\sum_{\beta_n}^{d_\nu}\Psi_{\alpha_p\beta_n} |J_p^{\pi_p},\alpha_p\rangle\otimes|J_n^{\pi_n},\beta_n\rangle.\]</span> Therefore these states can be used to compute the matrix elements of the full Hamiltonian (<a href="#sep" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sep">[sep]</a>), where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_p + \hat{H}_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_n+H_{nn}\)</span> are now used in their diagonal forms.</p>
<p>So far all we have done is to solve the nuclear Hamiltonian in a basis of coupled proton and neutron states by solving the proton and neutron interactions separately. The computational advantage to this procedure lies in the prospect of truncating the model space. In doing so, we will have to make choices to ensure that the eigenstates of the truncated Hamiltonian remain eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(J^2\)</span>. If we were to truncate the basis in an M-Scheme procedure, then our solutions would not be guaranteed to have good total angular momentum. To see why, consider the following example for a two state system. Imagine a basis with two states <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|z;+\rangle+|z;-\rangle)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|z;+\rangle-|z;-\rangle)\)</span>. If we were truncate to just one of either of these states, then any solution in the truncated basis could not be an eigenstate of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S}_z\)</span>. Similarly, a truncated M-scheme basis is not guaranteed to have good total angular momentum. Therefore, we choose a basis with good total angular momentum so that even once we truncate the basis we are guaranteed to get solutions with good total angular momentum. This is called a J-scheme.</p>
<p>Therefore we choose to couple our proton and neutron states in such a way as to be eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{J}^2\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\label{cbasisJ}
	[|J_p^{\pi_p},\alpha_p\rangle\otimes|J_n^{\pi_n},\beta_n\rangle]_{J^\pi}\equiv
	|J_p^{\pi_p},\alpha_p,J_n^{\pi_n},\beta_n;J^\pi\rangle,\]</span> A wavefunction expanded in this basis is of the form <span class="math display">\[|\Psi\rangle = \sum_{\alpha_p\beta_n}^{Q}\Psi_{\alpha_p\beta_n} 
    |J_p^{\pi_p},\alpha_p,J_n^{\pi_n},\beta_n;J^\pi\rangle,\]</span> and is guaranteed to have good total <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. Here, the sum runs up to <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, which will be chosen to be <span class="math inline">\(Q &lt;&lt; min[d_p,d_n]\)</span> when computing the matrix elements of (<a href="#sep" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sep">[sep]</a>).</p>
<h2 id="factorizing-the-proton-neutron-interaction">Factorizing the Proton-Neutron Interaction</h2>
<p>To calculate the matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(H_{pn}\)</span>, we refactor equation (<a href="#eqn: hpn" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: hpn">[eqn: hpn]</a>) into one-body density-like operators whose matrix elements can be computed from the density matrices found from solving the single-species terms (see equation (<a href="#ppnnsol" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ppnnsol">[ppnnsol]</a>)) of the full Hamiltonian (<a href="#sep" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sep">[sep]</a>).

<h2 id="matrix-elements">Matrix elements</h2>
<p>Matrix elements can now be computed in our basis of coupled proton-neutron states using the above form of the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of density operators.

These are just the proton and neutron density matrices represented in the basis of uncoupled proton and neutron states, respectively. Recalling that these uncoupled states are the eigenstates of the pure proton and pure neutron parts of the full Hamiltonian, these density matrices are density matrices produced by BIGSTICK when computing <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span>.</p>

In PNISM, the user can either select the included Lanczos algorithm to solve for low lying states or to use the full Householder diagonalization option using the routine SSYEV from the LAPACK<span class="citation" data-cites="LAPACK"></span> library, at the cost of increased run time.</p>
<p>The next major step is to calculate the one-body density matrices, used to calculate transition strengths. This is addressed in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="one-body-density-matrices">One-body density matrices</h2>
<p>A basic functionality of any configuration interaction code is the ability to calculate density matrices. A general one-body density matrix is defined by <span class="math display">\[\label{eq.densitymat}

<p>In order to calculate the density matrix elements between the eigenstates of the proton- neutron Hamiltonian, which are output from PNISM in the basis of coupled proton and neutron wavefunctions, we need to be able to write (<a href="#eq.densitymat" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq.densitymat">[eq.densitymat]</a>) in terms of the density matrices provided by BIGSTICK. These, however, are computed in the basis of pure proton and pure neutron wavefunctions.

<p>This concludes the analytic discussions necessary to write the proton neutron interacting shell model code, PNISM. We have the expression for both the Hamiltonian matrix elements in terms of quantities which can be obtained from solutions from BIGSTICK (or any properly formatted results from an interacting shell model code), and the one-body density matrices which are used to compute transition rates. Although the code for computing one-body density matrices has been written and tested, we have yet to apply it. Equation (<a href="#eqn: hmat" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: hmat">[eqn: hmat]</a>) along with (<a href="#eqn: wmat" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: wmat">[eqn: wmat]</a>) and (<a href="#eqn: denmat" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: denmat">[eqn: denmat]</a>) are the actual equations coded up in PNISM.</p>
<h1 id="chap:computation">COMPUTATION</h1>
<p>PNISM is a post processing code for BIGSTICK and relies on results from BIGSTICK in order to compute nuclear wavefunctions. Johnson wrote the majority of the subroutines responsible for reading in formatted results from BIGSTICK output files, as well as for constructing the basis. I aided in a few bug fixes in the modules responsible for reading in the density matrices (see "Challenges and Speedup"). I then wrote the majority of the code responsible for computing the proton-neutron-coupled-Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(H_{pn}\)</span>, for solving the Hamiltonian, for computing the density matrices, and for writing the results to file. In this section I outline the flow of information and the algorithms and computations carried out. I leave out most of the theoretical details, as this is discussed in previous chapters, and focus on the computation.</p>
<p>The explicit proton-neutron formalism Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[H = H_p + H_{pp} + H_n + H_{nn} + H_{pn}.\]</span> BIGSTICK is used to solve <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span> independently, before the PNISM runtime. Then PNISM reads in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The single particle orbit space</p></li>
<li><p>The two-body matrix elements <span class="math inline">\(\langle ab,JT|V|cd,JT\rangle\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The energy levels and quantum numbers from both <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The density matrices from both <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span>, from solutions of different <span class="math inline">\(M\equiv J_z\)</span> values</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After reading the all of the necessary resources, PNISM creates the basis by coupling the eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span> up to states with good total angular momentum. Then, the array containing <span class="math inline">\(W_K(ac,bd)\)</span> is computed from the two-body matrix elements and with six-J symbols which are either computed on the fly or read in from a table stored on disk. Then, the largest portion of runtime takes place when the Hamiltonian matrix elements are computed using the diagonalized matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span>, the array containing <span class="math inline">\(W_K(ac,bd)\)</span>, the density matrices of <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span>, and again the six-J symbols. PNISM then diagonalizes the Hamiltonian matrix, thus solving the many-body Schrodinger equation. The resulting quantum numbers and eigenvectors are used to calculate the one-body density matrices and the results are written to a file in the same format as would be produced by BIGSTICK.</p>
<h2 id="reading-in-density-matrices">Reading in Density Matrices</h2>
<p>PNISM must read in multiple solutions from BIGSTICK for the same proton/neutron configuration because BIGSTICK is an M-scheme code. A solution for a given <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> value will have some number of zero density matrix elements due to symmetries in the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Density matrices from BIGSTICK are actually reduced density matrices. A reduced matrix element of a tensor operator is a way to represent the matrix element of an operator without regard to the orientation in space. This is accomplished with the Wigner-Eckart theorem <span class="citation" data-cites="Edmonds"></span>: for a tensor operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{O}_KM\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}\label{eqn: wigner}
    \langle J_fM_f|\hat{O}_{KM}|J_iM_i\rangle &amp;= 
        [J_f]^{-1}(J_iM_iKM|J_fM_f)\langle J_f|\hat{O}_k|J_i\rangle \\
    &amp;= (-1)^{J_f-M_f}\begin{Bmatrix} J_f &amp; K &amp; J_i \\ -M_f &amp; M_K &amp; M_i \end{Bmatrix}
        \langle J_f|\hat{O}_k|J_i\rangle,
\end{split}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\([j] \equiv \sqrt{2j+1}\)</span> and the six-argument array is the six-J symbol. <span class="math inline">\(\langle J_f|\hat{O}_k|J_i\rangle\)</span> are the reduced density matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(\langle J_fM_f|\hat{O}_{KM}|J_iM_i\rangle\)</span>. A basic symmetry of vector coupling coefficients is<span class="citation" data-cites="Edmonds"></span> <span class="math display">\[\label{eqn: vcphase}
    (j_a m_a j_b m_b | J M) = (-1)^{j_a+j_b-J}(j_bm_bj_am_a|JM)\]</span> It can be shown by applying time reversal symmetries to equation (<a href="#eqn: vcphase" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: vcphase">[eqn: vcphase]</a>) that<span class="citation" data-cites="Edmonds"></span> <span class="math display">\[(j_a m_a j_b m_b | J M) = (-1)^{j_a+j_b-J}(j_a -m_a j_b -m_b | J -M).\]</span> Thus if <span class="math inline">\(m_a=m_b=M=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j_a+j_b-J\)</span> is odd, the coefficient must be zero. This creates a problem for some of our reduced density matrices since we divide by this quantity. To recover the missing density matrix elements, we simply recompute <span class="math inline">\(H_p + H_{pp}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_n + H_{nn}\)</span> for another value of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. In practice, only <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> solutions are required to obtain nearly the entire solution. PNISM will only read in nonzero density matrix elements.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> basis states cannot have <span class="math inline">\(J=0\)</span> total angular momentum (the total angular momentum can’t be less than its z-component). Thus <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span> solutions from BIGSTICK are missing all <span class="math inline">\(J=0\)</span> solutions. It is therefore necessary to read in <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> solutions first when setting up the basis. The overall phase of the density matrix elements first read in are taken to be the convention. An important obstacle that had to be overcome resulted from an ambiguity of quantum mechanics. When solving the Schrodinger equation, the overall sign of the wavefunction is not important, since it does not affect any observables. However, the relative phase between two wavefunctions is important, so care must be taken to establish self consistent phases. Because PNISM inputs solutions from BIGSTICK, the phase between two separate solutions, say, for two different <span class="math inline">\(J_z \equiv M\)</span> values (BIGSTICK is an M-scheme code) can differ. It is vital to check the relative phase between density matrices from different choices of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Neglecting this will result in unforeseen cancellations and a failure to correctly recreate the Hamiltonian. After the initial density matrix that PNISM reads in, new density matrix elements for a given basis state combination are compared against density matrix elements that have already been read in. If an inconsistent phase is encountered, the read in is restarted for that basis state combination and the phase is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="symmetries">Symmetries</h2>
<p>A number of basic symmetry relations were used to speed up calculations, the most obvious symmetry being the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian matrix elements. After basic testing, only the diagonal and upper triangular portion of the Hamiltonian is computed independently. The remaining matrix elements are then copied over across the diagonal.</p>
<p>The proton-neutron potential factor <span class="math inline">\(W_{K}(ac,bd)\)</span> which appears in equation (<a href="#eqn: wmat" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: wmat">[eqn: wmat]</a>) has a similar symmetry: <span class="math display">\[W_K(ac,bd) = (-1)^{j_a+j_d-j_b-j_c}W_K(ca,db),\]</span> which is used to compute all iterations over <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> by computing only the <span class="math inline">\(c\leq a\)</span> matrix elements. Another but slightly less trivial method was used to compute the one-body density matrices. The one-body density matrices respect the so called time reversal symmetry: <span class="math display">\[\label{eqn: trs}
     \langle \Psi_f| [\hat{c}^\dagger_a\otimes \hat{c}_b]_k |\Psi_i\rangle = 
        (-1)^{j_a-j_b+j_i-j_f}\langle \Psi_i|
            [\hat{c}^\dagger_b\otimes \hat{c}_a]_k |\Psi_f\rangle\]</span> This means that we only need to compute the upper triangular (in the a,b indices) elements of the one-body density matrices. The rest can be computed via the relation given in (<a href="#eqn: trs" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eqn: trs">[eqn: trs]</a>).</p>
<h2 id="numerical-methods">Numerical Methods</h2>
<p>The primary eigensolver used in PNISM is SSYSEV from the LAPACK library<span class="citation" data-cites="LAPACK"></span>. PNISM has the option to either use SSYEV directly, or to use a custom Lanczos solver. The Lanczos solver is useful when only extremal eigenstates are sought. The Lanczos solver uses a straightforward lanczos iteration subroutine written by another graduate student, Ryan Zbikowski. The Lanczos method is discussed in Appendix A. In my implementation, I use an iterative process to incrementally increase the number of Lanczos iterations until some fixed number of eigenvalues converges. Convergence is measured by a somewhat crude criterion: <span class="math display">\[Crit = \frac{1}{N_{keep}-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{keep}} |\lambda_i^{Current}-\lambda_i^{Previous}|.\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i\)</span> are the first <span class="math inline">\(N_{keep}\)</span> eigenvalues produced by solving the Lanczos matrix. The process is said to have converged when the value of <span class="math inline">\(Crit\)</span> falls below some constant. In PNISM the value <span class="math inline">\(0.001\)</span> is used. This is a similar convergence criterion to that used in BIGSTICK and empirical tests show that it converges to the correct values.</p>
<p>In some cases where the total dimension of the matrix is small compared to the number <span class="math inline">\(N_{keep}\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(Crit\)</span> value will fail to become small enough, even when the number of lanczos iterations is maximum (equal to the dimension of the matrix). When this happens an flag is thrown and the code runs SSYEV instead.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-and-speedups">Challenges and Speedups</h2>
<p>Computing the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in PNISM takes most of the overall runtime. Several actions were take to help reduce this runtime. Using the Unix profiling tool GPROF, I found that a large percentage of compute time was used in calling the function used to compute Six-J symbols, a function with six arguments and calls to other subfunctions within an external library. In order to reduce the time used computing six-J symbols, I wrote a small code to create a table of six-J tables called sj2i.f90. The code asks the user for six inputs, the six maximum value of angular momentum, <span class="math inline">\(J_{max}\)</span>, to compute the six-J symbol for. The six-J symbols are then computed for all combinations of argument values from zero to Jmax and written to a file with the following format:</p>
<pre><code>    j1 j2 j3 j4 j5 j6 six-j(j1,j2,j3,j4,j5,j6)</code></pre>
<p>In order to save disk space and I/O time, the file is written as an ’unformatted’, non-ASCII file. Before any computation, PNISM reads the contents of the file into an array:</p>
<pre><code>    sj2i_table(j1+1,j2+1,j3+1,j4+1,j5+1,j6+1) 
                            = six-j(j1,j2,j3,j4,j5,j6)</code></pre>
<p>At the time when this document was written, the entire Hamiltonian for all total J values is computed sequentially, and then solved afterward. This is a waste of memory since each total J Hamiltonian is independent and can be solved before the next is computed and committed to memory. A future project will be to solve each matrix as soon as it is computed. This should reduce the maximum memory requirements by approximately a factor equal to the total number of total-J values requested, i.e. if computing J-total from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> then as much as one-tenth the total memory will be required with little cost to runtime.</p>
<h1 id="chap:results">RESULTS</h1>
<p>There are two classes of results discussed here: ground state energy convergence and excitation spectra of atomic nuclei. Existing interacting shell model codes such as BIGSTICK have errors with respect to experiment of around a few hundred keV. Since our interacting shell model PNISM is an approximation to these results found in BIGSTICK, and are bounded by the variational principle (see Appendix <a href="#VP" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="VP">9.6</a>), we expect the results computed by PNISM to converge to the results of BIGSTICK as the size of the basis is increase. Ground state energies are found to converge exponentially and monotonically with the size of the basis, and excitation spectra also converge to the results of BIGSTICK, although in a more sporadic and unpredictable way. This is because PNISM is a J-scheme code: we should expect that the excitation spectra for fixed-J to obey the variational principle, but a plot of low-lying excitations, having mixed J-values, will have non-monotonic convergence curves. This can be understood by realizing that as each fixed-J excitation spectra settles downward towards the energy of the untruncated basis, the gaps between ordered energy levels may grow or shrink as excitation spectra from different J values converge at different rates. This can be seen in the excitation plots at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>Results demonstrate the exponential convergence of the ground state energy as a function of the number of states retained, for nuclei where a full diagonalization is possible even on a laptop. Results are given for sample nuclei in both the sd shell and the pf shell. When all of the states are retained, the results are exactly equal to those of BIGSTICK. Results also demonstrate the convergence of low-lying excitations in the sd and pf shells. When all of the states are retained, the results are exactly equal to those of BIGSTICK for all excitation levels. Qualitatively one can observe that <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;Z\)</span> nuclei tend to converge faster than <span class="math inline">\(N=Z\)</span> nuclei.</p>
<p>In order to examine the convergence of the wavefunctions, we calculated the density matrices for nuclei in both model spaces. As expected, when all of the states are included, the results converge to those of BIGSTICK.</p>

<h2 id="heavy-nuclei">Heavy Nuclei</h2>
<p>In the future we would like to target a number of specific nuclei relevant to important experimental physics. In this section I will provide estimates for the dimension of these problems in the M-scheme, and the dimensions of the proton and neutron Hamiltonians that would need to be solved in their place in order to construct the J-scheme basis.</p>
<p>Some experimental searches for non-baryonic dark matter involve collisions with heavy nuclei such as <span class="math inline">\(^{131}\)</span>Xe, and require detailed nuclear structure calculations<span class="citation" data-cites="Bednyakov"></span>. Xe isotopes, as well as the Cs isotopes for studying the nuclear anapole moment, can both be computed in the model space with single particle orbits: <span class="math display">\[\label{gcn5082}
    g_{7/2},\ d_{5/2},\ d_{3/2},\ s_{1/2},\ h_{11/2},\]</span> which will be referred to as the GCN5082 model space, after the name of the interaction file used for this configuration space. The M-scheme dimension of <span class="math inline">\(^{133}\)</span>Cs and <span class="math inline">\(^{131}\)</span>Xe are both around <span class="math inline">\(1.98 \times 10^8\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(^{131}\)</span>Xe has <span class="math inline">\(77\)</span> neutrons and <span class="math inline">\(54\)</span> protons, while <span class="math inline">\(^{133}\)</span>Cs has <span class="math inline">\(78\)</span> neutrons and <span class="math inline">\(55\)</span> protons. The fact that these both have an unequal number of protons and neutrons is encouraging; our J-scheme approximation is predicted to be well suited for such nuclei.</p>
<p>The origin of the matter-antimatter symmetry violation may be due to CP-violation<span class="citation" data-cites="Sakhorav"></span>, and one approach to investigating the source of CP-violation is through the permanent electric dipole moments of certain nuclei such as <span class="math inline">\(^{199}\)</span>Hg<span class="citation" data-cites="Willmann"></span>. Model spaces for nuclei with such a high mass number do not yet exist, and we would have to create the interaction for it. Nonetheless we can still predict the M-scheme dimensions of the proton and the neutron parts of the Hamiltonian. <span class="math inline">\(^{199}\)</span>Hg has <span class="math inline">\(80\)</span> protons and <span class="math inline">\(119\)</span> neutrons. This means that the proton Hamiltonian will most likely be computed in the GCN5082 model space (see equation (<a href="#gcn5082" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="gcn5082">[gcn5082]</a>), and the neutron Hamiltonian would have to be computed in a new shell model space. This could be defined by the set of orbitals <span class="math display">\[\label{newspo}
   1h_{9/2},\ 2f_{7/2},\ 2f_{5/2},\ 3p_{3/2},\ 3p_{1/2},\ 1i_{13/2},\]</span> which corresponds to between <span class="math inline">\(82\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(126\)</span> nucleons. (The next pair of consecutive magic numbers.)</p>
<p>Table <a href="#estimates" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="estimates">7.5</a> contains estimates for the M-scheme dimension of the Hamiltonian for these nuclei of interest. It also provides estimates for the M-scheme dimension of the proton Hamiltonian and the neutron Hamiltonian that would need to be solved in order to compute the J-scheme basis for PNISM. These are orders of magnitude smaller than the full interaction’s dimension. The estimted dimension of the M-scheme proton Hamiltonian for <span class="math inline">\(^{199}\)</span>Hg corresponds to a calculation in the GCN5082 space, while the neutron Hamiltonian is estimated for the new single-particle space defined by (<a href="#newspo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="newspo">[newspo]</a>).</p>

<h1 id="chap:conclusion">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</h1>
<p>This thesis was a study of proton-neutron entanglement entropy and the presentation of a new interaction shell model code, PNISM. It was shown that the proton-neutron entanglement entropy is inversely correlated with the isospin of a atomic nuclei. This hypothesis was further supported by a decomposition of nuclear wavefunctions into pure proton and pure neutron eigenstates, which fall off exponentially. The fact that nuclei with greater isospin appear to have weaker proton-neutron coupling suggests that heavier nuclei with high isospin could be computed with even greater efficiency using this truncation scheme.</p>
<p>We wrote a J-scheme interacting shell model code which takes proton wavefunctions and neutron wavefunctions and creates a truncated basis of coupled proton and neutron wavefunctions. The nuclear Hamiltonian is computed in this basis and solved using standard numerical techniques. The ground state energy and wavefunctions converge exponentially to those of the full model space. The results for three nuclei in the (<span class="math inline">\(p_{1/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_{3/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_{5/2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_{7/2}\)</span>) model space, which would normally require a supercomputer to solve, were computed using PNISM running on a laptop. Results are not satisfactory and further research will need to be done to improve convergence. Eventually we would like be able to compute nuclei with full model space dimensions in the billions using truncated model spaces in PNISM; however we are still working on some bugs to do with model spaces with more than one parity.</p>
<p>In the future we will need to make changes to the code to improve convergence. The model presented here is the simplest version in that basis states are selected from the lowest eigenstates of the proton and neutron Hamiltonians. This could be improved by introducing effective single-particle energies to account for the contribution from the remaining states which were left out, perhaps through some mean-field approximation.</p>
<p>In the current version, PNISM computes the entire set of Hamiltonian matrix elements before diagonalizing. Memory utilization could be greatly improved by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian after completing each value of total angular momentum. This is possible since PNISM is a J-scheme code; matrix elements between states with different total <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> are independent. Here is a pseudo-code depiction of the current procedure:</p>
<pre><code>    DO J = JMIN, JMAX
        COMPUTE &lt;AB,J| H |CD,J&gt;
    END DO
    DO J = JMIN, JMAX
        DIAGONALIZE &lt;AB,J| H |CD,J&gt;
    END DO
    DEALLOCATE &lt;AB,J| H |CD,J&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The problem being that this requires storing the entire Hamiltonian in memory before diagonalizing and writing to disk the much smaller set of truncated eigenstates and quantum numbers. If instead we use the following procedure:</p>
<pre><code>    DO J = JMIN, JMAX
        COMPUTE &lt;AB,J| H |CD,J&gt;
        DIAGONALIZE &lt;AB,J| H |CD,J&gt;
        DEALLOCATE &lt;AB,J| H |CD,J&gt;
    END DO</code></pre>
<p>then we can expect a reduction in the total memory resources required by a factor that scales like the number of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> states required. While simple in principle, this will require a nontrivial restructuring of the code.</p>
<p>This reorganization of the code would also be compatible with a hybrid implementation of MPI<span class="citation" data-cites="mpi"></span> and openMP<span class="citation" data-cites="openmp"></span>. MPI is a distributed memory message passing interface commonly used for parallelization. MPI will be called to distribute iterations of the loop over <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> values to various nodes of a cluster. Each node, being assigned some allotment of work, will create numerous threads using openMP, a shared memory multi-processing programming interface. If only one node is available, then creation of openMP threads will be preferred.</p>

<h2 id="vector-coupling-coefficients">Vector Coupling Coefficients</h2>
<p>Vector coupling coefficients, commonly referred to as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients <span class="citation" data-cites="Shankar"></span> are simply the coefficients of an expansion of a coupled angular momentum state with fixed total <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> in a basis of coupled states <span class="math inline">\(|j_1m_1,j_2m_2\rangle\equiv|j_1m_1\rangle\otimes|j_2m_2\rangle\)</span>. That is to say, in the expansion <span class="math display">\[|j_1j_2;JM\rangle=\sum_{m_1m_2}|j_1m_1,j_2m_2\rangle\langle j_1m_1,j_2m_2|j_1j_2;JM\rangle,\]</span> the inner products <span class="math inline">\(\langle j_1m_1,j_2m_2|j_1j_2;JM\rangle\)</span> are the vector coupling coefficients. This are often written as <span class="math display">\[(j_1m_1j_2m_2|JM)\equiv \langle j_1m_1,j_2m_2|j_1j_2;JM\rangle\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[|j_1j_2;JM\rangle = \sum_{m_1m_2} (j_1m_1j_2m_2|JM) |j_1m_1,j_2m_2\rangle.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="j-symbol">3-j Symbol</h2>
<p>An alternative to the vector-coupling coefficients are the so called three-J symbols (3-j symbols). They are defined in terms of the vector coupling coefficients for the coupling of three angular momenta<span class="citation" data-cites="Edmonds"></span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{Bmatrix}j_1&amp;j_2&amp;j_3\\m_1&amp;m_2&amp;m_3\end{Bmatrix} \equiv
        (-1)^{j_1-j_2-m_2}(2j_2+1)^{-1/2}(j_1m_1j_2m_2|j_1j_2j_3-m-3).\]</span></p>
<h2 id="j-symbols-and-9-j-symbols">6-j Symbols and 9-j Symbols</h2>
<p>Six-J and Nine-9 symbols are generalizations of vector coupling coefficients which often appear in calculations involving complex angular momentum algebra. I refer the reader to Edmonds<span class="citation" data-cites="Edmonds"></span> for a complete description.</p>
<h2 id="appendix: svd">Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
<p>A singular value decomposition is a eigenvalue decomposition, generalized to non-square non-symmetric matrices. The method of singular value decomposition comes from a theorem which tells us that any <span class="math inline">\(M \times N\)</span> matrix A with <span class="math inline">\(M \geq N\)</span> can be written as the product of an <span class="math inline">\(M \times N\)</span> column-orthogonal matrix U, an <span class="math inline">\(N \times N\)</span> diagonal matrix W with positive or zero elements (the singular values), and the transpose of an <span class="math inline">\(N \times N\)</span> orthogonal matrix V<span class="citation" data-cites="NumRec"></span>. That is, <span class="math display">\[A_{M \times N} = U_{M \times N} W_{N \times N} V_{N \times N}^T\]</span> or in matrix notation, <span class="math display">\[A_{ij} =  \sum_{a=1}^N U_{ia}  \sum_{b=1}^{N} W_{ab} V_{jb}\]</span> Which, for the case where <span class="math inline">\(M=N\)</span>, simply states that we can write a matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as a unitary transformation of a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[A_{ij} = \sum_{ab}U_{ia}W_{ab}U_{jb}.\]</span></p>
<h2 id="lanczos-method">Lanczos Method</h2>
<p>This is an overview of the Lanczos method<span class="citation" data-cites="lanczos"></span> used in this research. The Lanczos Algorithm is used to obtain the extremal eigenvalues of an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> Hermitian matrix in <span class="math inline">\(m&lt;n\)</span> linear operations. This is done by transforming the Hermitian matrix into a truncated tridiagonal matrix containing the extremal eigenvalues,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = V^\dagger H V\]</span></p>
<p>We begin with an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> real-symmetric matrix <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and a fixed number <span class="math inline">\(k&lt;&lt;n\)</span> of iterations to carry out. Generate a random normalized vector <span class="math inline">\(v(0)\)</span> of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and carry out the following procedure:</p>
<pre><code>    FOR all Lanczos iterations
        |w&gt; = H|v(i)&gt;
        a(i) = &lt;v(i)|w&gt;

        ! Orthogonalize against initial vector
        |w&gt; = |w&gt; - a(i)|v(i)&gt;  

        IF (i&gt;1), FOR all previous iterations
            ! Orthogonalize against prior vectors
            |w&gt; = |w&gt; - &lt;v(j)|w&gt;|v(j)&gt; 

        b(i) = |w|
        |v(i+1)&gt; = |w&gt;/b(i)            </code></pre>
<p>After <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> iterations, the vectors <span class="math inline">\(v(i)\)</span> form the transformation matrix <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> contain the diagonal and subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>This algorithm can be used to extract the extremal eigenvalue and eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. By diagonalizing <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, one can find <span class="math inline">\(Tx = \lambda x\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are <em>similar</em> matrices and therefore have the same eigenvalues. Simultaneously <span class="math inline">\(H\psi = \lambda \psi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Tx = \lambda x\)</span>, so <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    V^\dagger H Vx &amp;= \lambda x \\
    VV^\dagger H Vx &amp;= V\lambda x \\
    H Vx &amp;= \lambda Vx, 
\end{split}\]</span> thus <span class="math inline">\(\psi = Vx\)</span> tells us how to obtain the eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> given the eigenvectors of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="VP">Variational Principle</h2>
<p>The Variational Principle is an extremely useful theorem in quantum mechanics as it is the basis of many methods. The principle states that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in any state is greater than or equal to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in the ground state. Suppose we have a Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> and an arbitrary state <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle\)</span> both in some Hilbert space H. Because <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> is Hermitian, we are guaranteed that it has a complete set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, <span class="math inline">\({|\psi\rangle_i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({E_i}\)</span>. Suppose that the lowest eigenstate has some, perhaps unknown, eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(E_0\)</span>. The Variational Principle is that the expectation value of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\frac{\langle \phi|\hat{H}|\phi\rangle}{\langle \phi|\phi\rangle} \geq E_0.\]</span> This is straightforward to prove since we can always write <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle = \sum_ic_i|\psi\rangle_i\)</span>. Then equation (1) can be written <span class="math display">\[\begin{split}
    \frac{\langle \phi|\hat{H}|\phi\rangle}{\langle \phi|\phi\rangle} &amp;= 
    \frac{\sum_jc^*_j\langle \psi|_j\hat{H}\sum_ic_i|\psi\rangle_i}{\sum_jc^*_j\langle \psi|_j\sum_ic_i|\psi\rangle_i} \\
    &amp;= \frac{\sum_{j,i}c^*_jc_i\langle \psi|_j\hat{H}|\psi\rangle_i}{\sum_{j,i}c^*_jc_i\delta_{i,j}} \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{\sum_{i}|c_i|^2}\sum_{j,i}c^*_jc_iE_i\delta_{j,i} \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{\sum_{i}|c_i|^2}\sum_{j}|c_j|^2E_j
\end{split}\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(E_0\leq E_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, each term satisfies <span class="math inline">\(|c_j|^2E_0\leq|c_j|^2E_j\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{\sum_{i}|c_i|^2}\sum_{j}|c_j|^2E_j \geq \frac{1}{\sum_{i}|c_i|^2}E_0\sum_{j}|c_j|^2 \geq E_0.\]</span> This inequality allows us to propose a model wavefunction and have the guarantee that our ground state will be bounded.</p>
<h1 id="sample-density-matrix-files">Sample Density Matrix Files</h1>
<p>Here I have provided some redacted density matrix files to provide some context for the discussion given on reading in density matrices. The following are data from input files to be read into PNISM. The format of the density matrix files is <span class="math display">\[\langle Final\ State|[\pi^\dagger_a \pi_c]_{J_t}|Initial\ State\rangle\]</span></p>
<p>These particle density matrix files are used for calculating <span class="math inline">\(^{20}\)</span>Ne in the sd model space with an inert <span class="math inline">\(^{16}\)</span>O core. This means that there are two valence protons and two valence neutrons. This first file contains the excitation spectra and density matrices for a nuclei with two protons and zero neutrons with <span class="math inline">\(M=J_z=0\)</span>.</p>

<p>This second files contains the excitation spectra and density matrices for a nuclei with two protons and zero neutrons with <span class="math inline">\(M=J_z=1\)</span>. Notice that the states number labels do not match up between the two files. The <span class="math inline">\(M=J_z=1\)</span> results are missing states with <span class="math inline">\(J=0\)</span>; you cannot have total angular momentum less than the z-component of the angular momentum. Also notice that density matrix elements between the same states (identified by <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> quantum numbers) are identical up to a phase. The <span class="math inline">\(M=J_z=1\)</span> density matrix file also has the entire set of <span class="math inline">\(J_t\)</span> quantum numbers for a given initial and final state while the <span class="math inline">\(M=J_z=1\)</span> density matrix file is missing odd <span class="math inline">\(J_t\)</span> quantum numbers. Both solutions are required by PNISM to obtain the entire density matrix.</p>
