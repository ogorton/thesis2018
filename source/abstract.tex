This thesis describes a nuclear shell model code which aims for a significant 
reduction in computer resource usage while 
retaining accuracy of results as compared to numerically exact solutions.
I begin with an introduction to the configuration interaction and shell
model calculations.
I then motivate the need for a proton-neutron decomposition of the Hamiltonian, and present
evidence for the viability of such a decomposition to reduce the size of the 
model space, through three different studies.  The first is a series of calculations of
proton-neutron entanglement entropy, a relatively novel approach in shell 
model calculations. Entanglement entropy measures the distribution
of wavefunction coefficients, and thus the viability of truncation
of a model space.
These calculations study the strength and origin of the 
isospin dependence of the proton-neutron entanglement entropy.
The second is a toy model that attempts to reproduce the entanglement entropy
properties of realistic nuclear calculations.
The third is a strength function decomposition of exact wavefunctions in 
an explicit proton-neutron formalism.
Finally, I discuss a code to calculate nuclear wave-functions by 
a coupling of proton and neutron wave-functions which are calculated beforehand 
by an existing interacting shell model code. 
Results and convergence properties of this code are provided and discussed.
